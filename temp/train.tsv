I'm shocked at who is actually unvaccinated..not who you think. I have to admit I was under the impression that the people who aren't unvaccinated were lazy People who don't give a toss about others, the ones who think restrictions don't apply to them, also the conspiracy theories and antivax brigade. But recently I spoke with some young women who are unvaccinated. Their logic( which is scientifically false) was blood clot risk, experimental vaccine and a friend of a friend was ill ect... Research is showing a very high% of women age between 18-35 make up a hugely disproportionation of the unvaccinated. At first they thought it was cause they are child bearing age, but more evidence is showing social media influence... Really sad.. people like Nicki Minaj should be permanently banned from platforms for spreading misinformation.	1
"Biopsy results Help to Interpret My wife had a colposcopy with an initial biopsy that showed CIN1 and CIN3 with HPV16 +. So we elected to have a CKC and ECC. Here are the results.

It appears the results came back good with no evidence of CIN3 and nothing abnormal in the endocervix. What is odd about the report is there is no mention of the margins nor any evidence of the CIN3 that was found in the initial biopsy.

For others who have ventured down this road I have some questions.

1. Is it possible to have CIN3 at the initial biopsy but then have nothing to report at the ckc? It seems odd to me. Is it possible the doctor completely missed the area of the cervix that had the CIN3?

2. How are you to interpret the results when there is no mention of clear margins or the width of the clean margin? It seems most people get back a report on the margins status to help decide next steps.

3. Are there specific questions we should ask the doctor about the biopsy results given the information in the report? The doctor hasnt called us yet as the report was just posted tonight. I do want to ask specifically about the margins and why no CIN3 was found. Of course my immediate thought is they biopsied the wrong spot and the cynic in me now questions everything.

Additional background. The strain of HPV was 16 and my wife was being closely looked at early due to 3 or 4 abnormal paps in between two kids over the last 5 years. Not until this last colposcopy did anyone tell us she was HPV + and the cause for the abnormal paps.

It has been stressful the last few weeks to say the least. I have a high level of health anxiety that brings me down pretty bad. These results relieve some of the anxiety I have but there are still some questions to be asked.

Thank you in advance!

"Mom is hounding me about making COVID vaccine appointment but I don’t want to do it Biggest reason I’m extremely terrified of needles and do not under any circumstance want to get two. If I absolutely have to do it I only want the one shot  version. 

I’m also highly concerned about the side effects it doesn’t seem normal to me that you are to expect awful side effects from a vaccine no other shot is like that that I have ever had. 

Third I’m just overall not that concerned about COVID. My parents have had the vaccine they were the only reason I was really concerned about catching it, I wear a mask, wash my hands etc. and am about as low risk as you could be for any complications. I’ve taken precautions but still tried to live my life as much as I can people who haven’t left the house in a year definitely are more concerned than me and I’d gladly give my spot to them. 

That being said I’m being hounded by my mother to book it, sending me links dropping off newspaper articles, etc. I don’t live with my parents but see them often and feel like she’s going to drive me insane until I do. I just really don’t want to go through with it. 

Any advice on pain/dealing with the needle and how to avoid side effects?"	-1
Did vaccines make measles rarer, but more deadly? Seems like it. 1/8,000 death rate by 1960. 1-2/1000 death rate by 2016? What happened? Did people just become unable to survive measles 8x more?	0
What vaccines should I get my child, if any? My baby is 2 months old and I really struggle with this topic. I don't want to inject him with whatever they put in the plastic syringes, but I also know people whom have lost their child that could've been prevented by vaccines. I feel like measles, small pox, ect. do their job but I'd like another opinion. Also, at what age would be best	0
"Appeals to the consensus of the pharmaceuticals, CDC, FDA, and WHO, are crap, as far as actual evidence goes. They have a history of corruption. So, we can't trust them by appeal of authority (and we should never, appeal to authority, at least not as a isolated reasoning). We actually have to look at the evidence they give, and often it's not convincing from any skeptical perspective. 

I trust the CDC when they have no reason to lie, but otherwise, I'm highly skeptical of their claims, as with their position, any old garbage can be written down and made to look like established fact to the gullible or conformative types.

Often, their own studies don't even conclude the same conclusion as is pushed in media and consensus. 

For example ""vaccines don't cause autism"" - study says ""we tested one ingredient of 50, 1 vaccine of 16, short term, unrigorously, and haven't found anything to accept or reject a link"". 

And that's not even taking into account the awful trap which is the healthy user bias.

Anyway, until there is a fair, unbiased system in place to properly anaylse cost benefit outcomes of macro scale vaccination, individual vaccines, and specific outcomes of vaccination on an individual level, then I'm not going to vaccinate. And the fact that there isn't, is a massive fucking issue. Whether or not vaccines are saving more than they kill, is unknown, but it makes me suspect, the fact that they don't have a system in place, on whether, at the very least, they are trying to hide the truth that vaccines aren't nearly as beneficial to public health as is commonly believed."	-1
"Heart-Related issues surging among young athletes  I am certain we have all heard of Bronny James' collapse due to cardiac arrest. This incident has become a catalyst for some form of hysteria among anti-vaxxers regarding COVID shots, claiming that these shots are what have been causing a surge in heart-related complications like myocarditis and deep vein thrombosis in many celebrities (Jamie Foxx, D'amar Hamlin, Al Roker, etc). 

My question is if this community agrees or at the very least acknowledges the existence of some connection between the shots and these cases, and if so, what is the likelihood of suffering from these complications years after taking the vaccine?"	0
"HPV vaccine, injuries, and skewed trials? Just read an interesting article on the HPV vaccine on what I think is an antivaxx site, and I would like to hear what the informed people on here have to say. I’m completely pro vaxx and my mom is too, but she actually never let me get the Gardasil vaccine because of all the injuries she said it has caused. My mom does not fall for pseudoscience and always does her research so that was the first thing that really peaked my interest in this vaccine. 

I don’t know much about it either way, and obviously this article is biased, but it claimed that over 2% of girls who get it develop autoimmune symptoms after, that the clinical trials were skewed and very fraudulent, and that the NIH basically didn’t care about the injuries in the trials since they profit from it and got it through the FDA. 

I know not everything in that article is true, but I feel like there might be some truth to some of it. Can anyone confirm/deny any of this, or give me some other resources to read?

"Cleared HPV - Positive Story! So I am in my mid-thirties and was diagnosed with high risk HPV two years ago (not 16/18/45, but another one). I read a lot of disheartening stuff about how you're less likely to clear the virus after 30, and I wanted to let you all know that is not always true. 

I cleared it! 

In 2021, I had a normal pap/high risk HPV, and I was told to come back in a year. I did, and still had the same result, which prompt a colposcopy, and a CINI result. I was told again to come back in a year. In 2023, I had a VERY hard year, and in no way took care of myself (I mean, I tried, but did nothing special - literally nothing; I actually gained weight and exercised less, haha). The only thing I could guess is that I got the updated vaccine in 2022. 

Regardless, I was 100% certain that I'd get the same result or worse, and was ready to push for a LEEP even for CINI. Instead I was told I was HPV negative + normal pap. No follow up needed.

So I wanted to let you know that even if you're ""older""/have a CINI/ the same result two years in a row, there is still a chance that your body can naturally clear this. Because, at the end of the day, most people do get rid of the virus without treatment."	1

Getting fully vaccinated twice Hey guys, so long story short, I got fully vaccinated (moderna) back in April 2021. Since then I changed my first name legally. I tried calling the mass vaccination site where I got it and no one was able to help about the name change on the card. I even checked the state immunization record and I couldn’t find my vaccine record on it.So im thinking about getting fully vaccinated again (Pfizer) just to get it over with and get a card with my new name on it. Is it safe to get fully vaccinated twice? Thanks!	1
"has anyone else had arm pain for many months following a vaccine? Edit: I am going to talk to my doctor about this on thursday, Im just curious if anyone else can relate.

I initially had a bad reaction to the meningitis b vaccine, I couldnt move my arm for a few days and the vaccine site was swollen. It healed after a couple weeks, but the injection site is stiff and hard to the touch compared to the rest of my arm.

This past fall I've had my covd and flu vaccines in the same arm as the mengb vaccine. They were not unusually painful, but the pain did not fully go away. The injection site still feels tender and hard to touch, the skin is hypersensitive, and there is some discomfort deep in the muscle when pressed. Its made sleeping on my left side to be quite uncomfortable.

There is no rash or swelling, and I have full range of motion in the shoulder.

Has this happened to anyone else?"	0

Hesitation with flu shot due to last experience. Help calm my nerves and misconceptions. Hello all, I (m28) wanted to start off by saying that I have been diligent about getting my covid vaccines and boosters since 2021, so I am far from anti-vax. But in 2015, I got my first flu shot in a long time and shortly after, I started to develop a lot of long-term health issues (GI-related and dysautonomia related). I’ve since gotten better but my mind keeps connecting the vaccine and those symptoms, and it makes me hesitant to get the flu shot. I want to get it, I’ve read up on studies, and I know the scientific evidence is there, but I have extremely bad anxiety when I think about the flu shot and the potential to get sick from it long term. Any help or words of reassurance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!	0
concerned for underage coworker i work with a 16 year old boy who is obviously autistic but during one chat with him he mentioned he mentally feels like child because he’s “vaccine sick.” he’s homeschooled and his mom also doesn’t let him eat soy because “it makes your penis shrink.” he also shows up with severe body odour and you can smell him when he’s not even in the room with you. it just makes me sad that people like this can raise children and fill their head full of propaganda. thanks for reading my quick rant.	0
"A different perspective on anti vaxxers? Don't get me wrong, vaccination is important, and has saved millions, that's not doubt-able, but I think anti vaxxers are mostly just good people that have good intentions, like 9/11 conspirators, who genuinely believe the government was at least somewhat involved in 9/11, and justice needs to be served, although they are wrong, they have good intentions mostly, or largely at least.

I think this is where the issue lies, (and I know it sounds shocking at first, just hear me out all the way) at least partially. It's that the CDC, themselves, admit that vaccines cause autism, and brain damage, and to some people, this causes a knee jerk reaction, to not vaccinate, or to think vaccines are bad, and the truth is, a few people getting brain damaged by vaccines, is far better than hundreds or thousands getting brain damaged, or killed by measles, or polio.

The reason, the CDC doesn't want people to know vaccines cause autism, is not because they're evil, it's because they know that this will cause massive fear, and make people irrationally stop vaccinating! 

A quote from Dr Richard Kelly who worked for the CDC was ''I agree with the CDC's statement on autism and vaccines as a public health measure, but not scientifically.''

Dr Paul Offit says ''We can't actually say vaccines don't cause autism, but we have to get used to saying it, because if we leave that door open, people will disproportionately react and we will see massive drops in vaccination!''

So basically, I think that vaccines can cause autism, but the chances of them doing so, and the complications of autism, are far less than the chances and complications of being injured or killed by diseases like measles, or diptheria."	0
"Did you know that 555 people out of 327.2 MILLION have contracted a non-fatal virus called measles this year? Wow, that’s about 0.0000017% of the US population. Sounds pretty scary, right?  

Did you know that measles outbreaks occur in vaccinated populations?  And measles is a side effect of the measles vaccine? Wait, does that  mean the vaccines aren’t working?  

Major measles epidemic in the region of Quebec despite a 99% vaccine coverage.

The vaccination coverage among cases was at least 84.5%. Vaccination  coverage for the total population was 99.0%. Incomplete vaccination  coverage is not a valid explanation for the Quebec City measles  outbreak. Canadian Journal of Public Health. 1991

[Evidence that vaccines do not provide real immunity.](https://www.learntherisk.org/news/measles-madness/?fbclid=IwAR3cq2-MujpZ-hOCOMs82D9ZnH-G9Ip3VIZDeDbIq6BakIwVtPYmA7mfeyw)Since vaccines are given by injection, they bypass the normal immune pathway and therefore do not trigger the cellular immune system, which science shows to be the main component necessary to create immunity. 

While the measles vaccine doesn’t reduce measles deaths, the vaccine does inject a live virus into children, some of who will end up developing measles. Yes, you read that right. The measles vaccine can cause measles. It’s even listed as a possible side effect of the vaccine on the [manufacturer’s product information sheet.](https://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/UCM123789.pdf)

The MMR measles vaccine product label shows measles as a potential reaction to the vaccine.[Source:](https://www.learntherisk.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/screen-shot-2019-01-30-at-11.10.05-300x139.png)

And here’s more proof: 38% of measles cases that were tested in the 2015 US outbreak were vaccine strain measles. So if an average of 40% of cases is the vaccine strain, it means the vaccine is causing these  cases. Will mandating further vaccines reduce measles… or increase it?

“During the measles outbreak in California in 2015, a large number of suspected cases occurred in recent vaccines. Of the 194 measles virus sequences obtained in the United States in 2015, [73 were identified as vaccine sequences”.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/9824838/)

"Im confused and scared…tbh I was diagnosed with HPV by sight about 2 months ago.  It’s so confusing to me because my husband who is SEVERELY IMMUNE COMPROMISED doesn’t have any symptoms or warts.  We have unprotected sex.  We are polyamorous and I always use protection…but I haven’t had a relationship or extramarital sex since 2018.
I was told I need to see a gynecologist and a plastic surgeon.  That I need a biopsy and that they’re going to have to cut this off, and also that my case is severe.  To be fair, what is going on seems severe.
Also it started with one bump on my perineum in 2020 after I had long covid.  I went to a gynecologist to have it checked out and was told it was a skin tag.  My Pap smear was irregular but the biopsy showed no signs of cervical cancer.  Because the doctor said it was a skin tag he didn’t remove it or biopsy it.  
I researched HPV and it said what I’m sure you all have seen.  That a healthy immune system will clear it.  Well it’s actually spreading.
It’s spread backwards and now I have them around my anus.  I never went to seek the surgery I was told I needed because I had plans to move, and I moved out of state.  Now I’m steadily bleeding from my anus and it is painful.  I have two choices and I would appreciate some advice.
I can try and make appointments back in Georgia but they would need to be close together and it would cost me north of 1k just in travel.  My other option is to call the marketplace and get a special enrollment for insurance in Nevada.  My husband, however, is on IG infusions that cost a small fortune and so the pharmaceutical company pays his deductible/out of pocket max so that the insurance company pays 100%.  We are unsure if they will do this again when we switch.
It seems like what I have is aggressive…but is it emergent?  Could it wait until January?  Do I need a third opinion?  I know this isn’t a substitute for medical advice.  I have been to many doctors and gotten very conflicting information.
What if it’s cancer?  How is my immune compromised husband clear?  How did this pop up 2 years after my last experience with another party, is that even realistic?  With protection?  Not on my genitals?"	0

About me: I am 21, female, morbidly obese - been obese most my life i think, I eat a lot of sugars and fat, not a lot of movement, 500-5000 steps a day, i have OCD including health anxiety, depression, asthma, i take lexapro

my symptoms: Gotten my period when i was 14. Irregular from the start, doc told me it‘s because if my weight. As i type this i weigh 170kg. Never done bloodwork at the gynaecologist. I also only got one cancer vaccine but not the other(s) because we missed the appointments. I am a virgin. Never had any sexual relations with anyone except SA which was without penetration. 
I have excess hair growth around belly button, chin, “beard”, imo a deep voice. We had androgens and testosterone tested which came back normal last year. I had a CT scan in 2022 because i thought i was feeling a lump on my abdomen, the report said cervix etc looks fine as far as they can see on the pics. I have irregular periods, like my last one i had 300 days ago. And that bleeding lasted for 80 something days. I was bleeding a LOT and sometimes very clumpy. It’d get less and then get more again the next day. I might also have to mention at that time i moved, without professional help and well it took me a month and u might be able to imagine that with my weight it wasnt easy. It was extremely hot and i never walked that much in my life. As often i’d get my period after excessively working out, so figured i should mention that as well. I sometimes get cramps, but not like endometriosis bad cramps. My breasts sometimes are really tender & i sometimes have a sharp pain at the right lower abdomen (one of the reasons for the scan back then). It’s only there for a few days a month though. I sometimes spot. After masturbation without penetration i sometimes get red discharge in the toilet when i pee but only very little, but only a few times a months, all the other times if i masturbate - nothing. 
I also have a buzzing sensation in my vagina sometimes, i read a lot about that and think it comes from bad pelvic floor muscles tho. But mentioning it just in case. 

I am just so scared. I have never been to an exam at the gynaecologist. My mom had cancer (thyroid) and i am just so scared like i am TERRIFIED. I am so convinced in my brain that i have cancer. ??"	0
"A new way to prevent getting Covid (and all the other scamdemics perpetuated by Democrats) A new way to prevent getting Covid (and all the other scamdemics perpetuated by Democrats)

We all know how deadly the vaccine can be. We ALSO know that the scamdemic known as  ""Covid-19"" was man-made so that Pharma can poison us with a mandatory vaccine. But I was listening to a really smart man on YouTube about his experience with vaccines and their horrors. He had a tip for preventing covid ""infections"" which I think is worth a try.

Basically, it involves electricity. Pharma doesn't want you to know how easily such a seemingly-unrelated form of science can zap away not only viruses, but various nut allergies caused by vaccines. Essentially all you need is a fork and an electrical outlet (like the ones in your house.) Simply take your metal fork and place it directly into the outlet. Almost instantly you can feel the germs burn away; the electrical current creates a shield around you protecting you from the scamdemics. Pharma and Fauci don't want you to know this, but if they say anything at all then it's *obviously* a lie.

- Biden advisor Richetti is lobbying to get Vaxart funding.
- Active recruitment ongoing, many newly hired employees and available positions. 
- Financial stability to survive on it's own for a long time without outside funds.

"4th dose of Pfizer I'll be travelling overseas for work soon and I've been fully vaccinated with Sinovac at my home country. Unfortunately, the country I'll be travelling to does not recognise Sinovac and of course, they require 2 doses of recognised vaccine to be considered fully vaccinated over there. I've since taken a Pfizer booster shot.

I can't find any articles online saying if it's safe to take that many doses of vaccine and I'm unsure about taking a 4th dose when I'm over there. If I do take it, that means I'll have 2 doses of Sinovac + 1 dose of Pfizer booster + 1 whatever vaccine they're giving me)"	1

I generally think vaccines are more safe than not, but the dishonesty around the Covid vaccine introduced a lot of hesitancy, a lot of questions, and a lot of attacks and smearing others.

OBGYN is pushing the TDAP hard, and initial research seems to make it actually look like a safe and good idea with nurses having horror stories of whooping cough (and unlike covid, it's been studied). 
But I'm also relatively against unnecessary / annual vaccinations, and in general against the massive age 2 bombardment - at least until they're 5 or 6 to reduce chances of autism. 

Can anyone provide objective and fact based info one way or another?"	0

"Syphilis Evades Immune System by Altering TprK Gene, Study Reveals Researchers at UW Medicine have identified that the syphilis bacterium, Treponema pallidum, evades the immune system by altering the TprK gene, which changes the surface protein of the bacterium. This genetic shuffling allows the bacteria to persist and re-infect individuals, complicating immunity and treatment. The findings could pave the way for new vaccines targeting this gene, offering hope in the fight against this resilient infection.

I don't want vaccines for my kid. That's my right. Some folks think this makes me crazy or dangerous but I'm fighting for your rights, too. My choice I've made for my kid is complicated and not the point of this post. As an adult, if you don't want a mandatory flu shot every year, mandatory STD vaccines, mandatory RSV vaccines, mandatory boosters to travel or renew your driver's license, that's your human right and I'm fighting for you too. There are dozens of vaccines in the pipeline and these are serious conversations being had among serious people. Everybody have a good day. And wash your hands.	0

"Those with invasive cervical adenocarcinoma experience - did you have warning signs? I've been recently diagnosed with cervical adenocarcinoma (invasive - not in situ). This is less than a week since I've received this news and so I feel like I'm trying to both educate myself as much as I can and also not lose my mind at the same time. I had my CT scan today and hope to hear more in the coming weeks (waiting sucks).

I went back to look at my medical record and testing history. It wasn't until 2021 that they found I was HPV+ for high risk strains. In early 2023 the HPV test came back showing AGUS of undetermined significance. I was monitored via colposcopy since then and as of last colpo - have been diagnosed with cervical cancer. 

Everything I've read says cervical cancer is a slow to progress cancer however, I went from HPV positive to this diagnosis in 3 years. I'm sorta dumbfounded. I had experienced weird menstrual cycles and bleeding / spotting after sex (sometimes painful sex), but those were my only warning signs (I didn't even connect the dots then). 

If you're willing to share, for those who have a similar diagnosis, what were your warning signs? "	-1

"Why Inovio deserves a $200 plus valuation: FACTS not “short” FICTION

First look at this and see everything they are working on. https://www.inovio.com/dna-medicines-pipeline/

Now let’s discuss the Benefits of Inovio’s ino-4800

INO-4800 is INOVIO's DNA vaccine candidate created to protect against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. 

Inovio is the only one that is in phase 2/3 without side effects and cold storage issues. 

Inovios INO 4700 for MERS. Only vaccine proven for  COV 1.

The best peer - reviewed animal data.
The best temperature stability. 
The broadest responce, inclusive Killer CD8+ T cells, Antiibodies, Memory cells and CD4+ helper T cells.
The bast safety ( no side effects, no Transverse Mielitis).

INO-4800 is the only nucleic-acid based vaccine that is stable at room temperature for more than a year and does not require to be frozen in transport or for years of storage, which are important factors when implementing mass immunizations to battle 

This one-of-a-kind platform delivers optimized DNA into cells, where it is translated into proteins that activate an individual's immune system to generate a robust targeted T cell and antibody response

Inovio’s DNA medicines are composed of optimized DNA plasmids, which are small circles of double-stranded DNA that are synthesized or reorganized by a computer sequencing technology and designed to produce a specific immune response in the body INOVIO states 'DNA medicines do not interfere with or change in any way an individual's own DNA.'

94% of Phase 1 trial participants demonstrated overall immune responses at Week 6 after two doses of INO-4800 in trial with 40 healthy volunteers in preliminary analyses

Week 8 INO-4800 regimen was deemed safe and well-tolerated with no serious adverse events; all reported adverse events were grade 1 in severity

In preclinical animal challenge study, INO-4800 provided full protection against SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lungs in mice challenged with the virus

Nature review:  In a previous study, In subjects immunized with INO-4700 (MERS-CoV S protein DNA vaccine) durable neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) and T cell immune responses were measured, and a seroconversion rate of 96% was observed and immunity was followed for 60 weeks in most study volunteers9.

Nature review: The INO-4800 vaccine induces cellular and humoral host immune responses that can be observed within days following a single immunization, including cross-reactive responses against SARS-CoV. The data demonstrate the immunogenicity of this COVID-19 synthetic DNA vaccine candidate targeting the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, supporting further translational studies to advance the development of this candidate in response to the current global health crisis.

Nature review: In summary, humoral immunogenicity testing in both mice and guinea pigs revealed the COVID-19 vaccine candidate, INO-4800, was capable of eliciting functional blocking antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

Nature review: In summary, T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 S protein epitopes were detected in mice immunized with INO-4800.

The DNA plasmid manufacture process allows for scalable manufacture of drug product, which has the potential to circumvent the complexities of conventional vaccine production in eggs or cell culture

DNA drug product is non-frozen and can be stored for 4.5+ years at 2–8 °C, room temperature (RT) for 1 year and 1 month at 37 °C, while maintaining potency at temperatures upwards of 60 °C. In the context of a pandemic outbreak, the stability profile of a vaccine plays directly to its ability to be deployed and stockpiled in an efficient and executable manner. 

- INO-4800 showed durable antibody and T cell responses in rhesus macaques for 4 months

NO-4800 is the only vaccine to demonstrate long-term protection in non-human primates challenged with SARS-CoV-2 virus 13 weeks from vaccination

Memory T and B cell responses resulted in reduced viral loads and faster viral clearance in macaques' lungs and nasal passages

INO-4800 vaccination generated antibodies neutralizing both the earlier strain of virus as well as the mutant variant (D614G) that has emerged with greater infectivity, and now accounts for &gt;80% of newly circulating virus

No antibody-dependent enhanced disease events were reported

INO-4800 reduced viral load in both the lower lungs and nasal passages in macaques that received two doses of INO-4800 (1 mg) four weeks apart and then were challenged with live virus 13 weeks after the second dose (study week 17). The reduced viral loads following exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection at this timeframe demonstrate an important durable impact mediated by INO-4800. 

INO-4800-treated animals demonstrated seroconversion after a single vaccination, with protective neutralizing antibodies and T cells lasting in their blood more than four months after the initial dose. The antibody levels were similar to or greater than those seen in patients who have recovered from COVID-19, the infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, and the T cell responses were significantly higher than those from convalescent patients.

The published data support that immunization with INO-4800 limits active viral replication and has the potential to reduce severity of disease, as well as reduced viral shedding in the nasal cavity. In the study, researchers assessed the ability of INO-4800 to induce acute and memory T cell and B cell immune responses, including neutralizing antibody responses against both early virus as well as now-dominant G614 mutant variants. To INOVIO's knowledge, this is the first report of vaccine-induced responses driving immunity against G614 variants. A strong anamnestic or memory T and B cell responses were demonstrated following challenge with the live virus.

""In addition to safety and efficacy, it is essential that any vaccine targeting SARS-CoV-2 generates a relevant durability of response,"" Dr. Broderick added. ""A vaccine that only provides protection for a very short period of time is not going to realistically solve the problem of this pandemic.""

In May, the peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications published an INOVIO study (""Immunogenicity of a DNA vaccine candidate for COVID-19"") showing that vaccination with INO-4800 generated robust binding and neutralizing antibody and T cell responses in mice and guinea pigs. The study was funded by a grant from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).

Oh and did I mention stable at room tempature  and 5yrs shelf life in refrig.

"Dangerous Antivax Misinformation: Ex-Nurse's Latest Post on Measles Remedies Hey everyone,

&#x200B;

I stumbled upon a concerning post by Kristen Nagle on Instagram, and I felt the need to share it here, especially in a community that values science and vaccination. Kristen Nagle is known for sharing dangerous antivaccine misinformation, and her recent post about natural remedies for measles is downright alarming.

&#x200B;

In her post, Nagle describes measles as a ""benign childhood illness"" and encourages parents to avoid vaccination, claiming that measles is a ""rite of passage"" that actually benefits children by boosting their immune system and detoxing their bodies. This couldn't be further from the truth. Measles is a highly contagious disease that can lead to serious complications, including pneumonia, encephalitis, and even death, particularly in vulnerable populations such as infants and immunocompromised individuals.

&#x200B;

What's even more concerning is Nagle's promotion of so-called ""natural remedies"" for measles, which are not only ineffective but also potentially harmful. She suggests using fermented cod liver oil, catnip, lavender and peppermint oil, oat baths, and various herbs as treatments for measles symptoms. Not only are these remedies unproven, but they can also delay proper medical care and put children at risk of complications.

&#x200B;

I urge everyone to be cautious of misinformation like this and to report accounts that spread antivaccine propaganda. Nagle's Instagram account is a prime example of such harmful content, and it's important that we take action to prevent the spread of dangerous misinformation.

&#x200B;

If you come across Nagle's account or similar accounts promoting antivaccine rhetoric, please consider reporting them to Instagram. We need to work together to ensure that accurate information about vaccines and infectious diseases is accessible to everyone.

&#x200B;

Stay informed, stay safe, and let's continue to advocate for science-based healthcare practices.

&#x200B;

(Note: I intentionally omitted Nagle's Instagram handle to avoid directly promoting her account, but if you're interested in reporting it, you can search for her name on Instagram.)"	0
"6 months GW free. Saying goodbye to this sub. 25 yo Male here. 

With tears in my eyes I’m saying goodbye to this subreddit. I’m moving on leaving HPV behind. 

Been on this subreddit for over 7 months now.  I’ve a couple of post with a lil background regarding my HPV diagnosis in case you guys want to check them.

It’s been so tough mentally for me, I’ve spent nights crying about my diagnosis, I even thought about taking my own life because of this. I'd be weary all the time, sleeping as soon as I'd get off of work with no motivation whatsoever.

This thing hit me real bad, i quit doing the things I enjoyed, going out with friends, spending time with my family, playing soccer, even my workouts :( 

Before I leave this subreddit, I’d love to share and give encouragement words to anyone who's fighting HPV.  

Today I hit my 6th month free of GW. I only had 2 tiny GW that were cauterized by my doctor ( I had a third one that looked like it, but my doctor couldn’t really tell whether it was HPV or not and ended up getting rid of it) 

I visited my doctor numerous times during this 6 month period (most of these visits due to anxiety), he would check and monitor every time that there wouldn’t be any recurrences. During my last t visit he told me that it’s very likely that my immune system controlled the virus or got rid of it and that I could even have unprotected sex which I’ve decided not to do, not even “protected”  

please do not give up and keep pushing, HPV will be just a bump a long the road for the vast majority of us. Pick yourself up, do not be defatted by this. 

This crap is a lot more harmful to our mental health than our body. Go out for dinner with you family, friends, go hiking, hit the gym  please do not let this thing get on your head. Take care of yourself, eat healthy, do some exercise constantly and most importantly reach out to god, he’s got you ????

Our body reacts differently to this virus. This my last year in college, so I have a LOT of stress going on on, I also work so it’s quite hard to handle stress in a good way. 

I try to eat healthy all the time, veggies, fruits, green tea and of course work out 6 days a week. I quit taking supplements on my 4th month. I genuinely believe food's the best vitamin source that humans can have. 

And no, I’m not vaccinated. I’m planning to but currently I’m not. 

I know there will always be people who will talk shit and try to play with your mind telling you that you will always have low or high risk HPV, do not pay attention to what they say, there’s a lot of people who’s got rid of this virus. 

Remember not everyone make their way here, we have some pretty special cases of people that have had recurrences of positive results for years, but again their case is a lil more complicated than ours. 

Edit: Please try to avoid coming to this community of doing research through google if you have anxiety issues, that’s just gonna make things worse. Focus on the things you enjoy, much love for y’all :) 
 

Take care of yourselves and GOD bless y’all ????

"Almost had a breakthrough with my anti-vax mom. Can I convince her that vaccines are good? Hi! My Mum is anti-vax, and I almost had a breakthrough with her the other day. Her ex-partner is anti-vax and has convinced her or this. We're both at least nominally skeptical of government, but for differing reasons.

I am pro science and pro vaccine. I argued that there is independently verifiable evidence that vaccines work, that the evidence is out there if she were to look. That she needn't look for sources that come from states or ""big pharma"" (I argue that states and big pharma are a barrier to vaccine distribution and don't effectively combat disinformation)...

... that whilst we should be criticalof states a big companies, we should do so based on facts. The worldview in which all states have miraculously collaborated to pull a fast-one over the millions of independent scientists and medical institutions, who can independently verify their claims, that we have seen a massive fall in preventable ilnesses through vaccines, that governments have toppled etc. since the discovery of vaccines, for this to be a big ""lie"" would require such a distorted worldview as to be nonsensical. Basically the argument that governments aren't all powerful to pull such far-reaching conspiracies that could be disproven at such low-cost to an individual.

I didn't have any better arguments to hand off the top of my head. I reminded her that her ex-partner also believes a lot of different bullshit which she has since changed her mind on/disgreed with throughout. That seemed to sway her, and she seems more ""agnostic.""

I don't know how to best tackle this subject with her... any advice?"	1

"Masks and the vaccines don’t work! Why do we need to be forced to take a vaccine that doesn’t work, won’t stop getting the infection and only lessens symptoms, and can still be spread.

How In the world with all the evidence out there and the vaccinated still getting sick and spreading the virus to others can this continue. Your killer shot is killing our children. The fact that you deem yourself  free from any damages from this jab and when folks try to share their experiences they are silenced.This is the biggest corrupt scam of the century. 
Fauci you won’t be able to murder us all, you will get the %50 that won’t investigate or research what you’re doing, putting prophet over people with the government and hospitals and the big Pharma machine. Those sheep in this country and the media that will spoon feed and organize censorship and the global billionaires that are pulling the Strings that are killing our children and families and friends, and leaving us helpless to fight for our rights, by censoring our every negative comments about what is happening now with this bio weapon vaccine. Buying commercials and false messaging about this being so safe and effective, is a death sentence.
Tomorrow will start the NYC NAZI- ism fear mongering by limiting us once more with our civil rights, by closing off our establishments  unless we provide vaccine proof.
Totally UNBELIEVABLE!!
Maybe these new recommendations In Nyc will provide enough truths to those who still don’t believe and fail to see we are going backwards as a world and a nation and our rights as humans are being slowly revoked!!!

Why do anti vaxxers think they know everything? So many old people on Facebook who own Google think they're medical professionals and say stupid stuff. I.e Covid vaccines were made by the government to kill people, we don't need vaccines to survive longer, and the most funniest one I've heard was vaccines causing autism. I'm sure this has been discussed in this subreddit many times but now everytime I look at news stories on instagram, its like all the older people went from Facebook to instagram with their tinfoil hats and rant on about how the government's trying to kill us.

"Gardasil and random fallopian tube infection? Hi, 

I am very pro-vaccination, however, after getting the 2/3rd Gardasil shot when I was 13, a couple of months later, I developed a fallopian tube infection. My gyno tested me for every STD in the book despite me promising that I was NOT sexually active (they all came out negative, obviously lol) and then basically told me she didn't know how I got it. That particular gynecologist has since left the practice I go to, and the new gyno said that she didn't see much about it in my chart...turns out some of my charts information is missing, but that is a different story.

&#x200B;

Anyway, now that I am a college student taking an immunology course, it dawned on me that the infection was inflammation, something often caused by the innate immune system's response. While I know Gardasil is made of small proteins found on the outside of HPV and it is not attenuated, is there any chance that this reaction was simply my immune system ""defending"" against what I was exposed to in the vaccination? By no means am I saying Gardasil gave me a fallopian tube infection, and I would 100% still recommend it. However, from an immunological standpoint, does my theory make sense? "	1

"Concern about friends child My partner and I have a close friend whose wife is antivax. We both have children similar in age and while I don't agree with her choice, I let it be, it's her life, not mine. What happens though when that choice crosses a certain line?

Lately, I've become concerned about her child. He seems very unhealthy, his colour is completely off and he's not eating solids much very late. He just seems tired and lethargic compared to the happy boy he used to be. 

He is allergic to several foods, so she has eliminated these entirely in the household even though she was advised to gradually introduce them over time. It just seems like he's lacking something crucial in his diet. I'm not worried so much about vaccines, I can't force her but  he doesn't see a doctor because he's not allowed into a pediatric setting without them, so I feel she's missing certain observations and signs a doctor would otherwise see.

How do I approach her on this subject? I care about her and her family, it's just hard seeing her kid suffer."	0

"Are there limitations to vaccines? I am not anti-vaccine. Then again, I'm not pro-vaccine either. I guess you could say I'm agnostic. I am grateful for the advancements in medical technology that allow us to continually expand our life expectancy and reduce morbidity to increase quality of life - vaccines being one of those medical technologies.

However, I believe that the people that regularly visit this sub are probably in the best position to answer a question I've been thinking about....

Are there any limitations to vaccines? 

I'll expand. Let's just say that in the next 5 years, for one reason or another, the United States government is able to mandate that each person is required to submit to vaccination for all CDC-recommended vaccines that exist, including the yearly flu shot. Part one of my questions is - how many in this sub would support that?

Part two - within the next 10 years, new vaccines are created for 5 diseases.
* Ebola
* HIV
* Herpes
* The Common Cold
* Mononucleosis

The only catch is that each one of these new vaccines are literally brand new and since there is no way to ethically test vaccines and we have a mandated vaccine policy, we don't know if there are any potential side-effects. However, we do know one thing for sure:

One in one-hundred thousand people that received each of the vaccines above will die as a direct result of receiving it.

Which ones would you support being mandated? Which ones would you not?"	-1
"Why do vaccines cost so much money? After years of not having my shots I decided to get immunity testing done. It turns out that I only need my hepB and hepA vaccines.

I’m just wondering why it’s so damn expensive for something that is socially hazardous if not addressed? 

I live in Canada if that helps."	1
"Just being ""pro-vaxx"" is NOT enough. If you're only ""pro-vaxx"" without being ""ANTI-anti-vaxx"", then you're part of the problem. (Seriously.) Longtime lurker here, but I felt compelled to write this post. I might get downvoted for this, but really, the title says it all.

As experts predict a [new wave](https://patch.com/connecticut/weston-ct/30-new-connecticut-covid-19-cases-are-fully-vaccinated-dph) of the deadly Delta variant after Labor day, some people still think that getting vaccinated, and encouraging others to get vaccinated *when asked,* is ""good enough."" I'm sorry if this offends some of you, but **it isn't good enough anymore.**

Perhaps the people who feel that way have their hearts in the right place. I'm sure many do. But with the anti-vaxx narrative growing stronger by the day -- and with the ridiculous, infuriating [opposition to mandatory vaccination and vaccine passports](https://news.gallup.com/poll/354506/update-american-public-opinion-vaccination-requirements.aspx) constantly on the rise -- it's time now to choose a side and make it known.

It's *no longer good enough* to just get vaccinated and have ""rational conversations"" about the benefits of vaccines. If these people wanted to listen, don't you think they'd have gotten the jab already? How many millions of lives need to be lost before we say *enough is enough?*

**We are now morally obligated to be ANTI-anti-vaxx.** What does it mean to be ANTI-anti-vaxx?

- If someone can read a comment of yours (anywhere, but *especially* in this subreddit) without immediately knowing how strongly you feel about people who are anti-vaccine and anti-science, then you're *not* ANTI-anti-vaxx.

- If people around you (online **or** IRL) make anti-vaxx insinuations, or express any hesitancy in agreeing with you about the unparalleled importance of pro-vaccine policy -- and you neglect to force the issue and debunk their anti-vaxx nonsense with science -- then you're *not* ANTI-anti-vaxx.

- If the thought of getting your Delta booster jab causes you trepidation or makes you say ""Maybe I'll just wait and see what happens"", then you're *not* ANTI-anti-vaxx.

- If you associate -- in an amicable **or** neutral manner -- with anybody who has not received at least two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine (regardless if they claim ""medical exemptions"" or any other such nonsense), then you're *not* ANTI-anti-vaxx.

I could continue this list, but I'm sure you all get the point.

Mods, I respectfully and strongly recommend that you begin removing **all content** that is not ANTI-anti-vaxx, and banning repeat offenders of non-ANTI-anti-vaxx content. 

If we won't all commit to fighting for the truth in this world, then we shouldn't be surprised if we wake up one day with no truth, and no world, left to fight for.

I have never gotten a vaccine. Okay well the title is sort of a lie… I did get the COVID vaccine. But I have never gotten any other vaccine in my life. I am a 21 year old female and growing up my father (who is now passed) was a chiropractor and against immunization. He never wanted me or my sister to get our vaccines growing up. So when my elementary/middle/high school and college needed me to present proof of vaccination my family went to a chiropractor who made fake religion exemptions for my school?? anyways, like I said I am 21 now and I have no vaccines except for my COVID vaccine. Some of the vaccines are for diseases that haven’t had outbreaks in my area in decades. Is this okay for me to not get my vaccines? Or should I get them? I don’t use needles or practice unsafe sex with just anybody, I haven’t gotten terribly sick at all throughout my life or had/have any diseases and my immune system is not compromised in any way. I would just like some feedback to see what people think.	0
To all You all are a bunch of fuck heads vaccines help with health if you dont get you kids vaccinated they will get the disease but you think oh no they will get autism and all this other shit science had shown that ot doesnt dont belive me look it anyways have fun putting your kids in the ground in the nexxt few years	1
"Doctor never gave further information My doctor called me yesterday to tell me that my pap from beginning of August is abnormal.  I have to go for a colopascy  (no idea the spelling but you know what I’m trying to say).  She never specified hpv results and I last had my std testing two months ago and it was clear.  I don’t now if they check for hpv though as I’m told they don’t unless you ask for it in other subs.  
I also have cold sores so I guess that’s a strain of it ? 
Would my doctor have had to specify I had hpv on the call for abnormalities ? I don’t think I zoned out and she said it. I was very much only tuned into what she was saying after abnormal.  
I had a pap done at another clinic that does my regular std checking in march and it came back normal.   
I’m also upset because I almost denied my doctor doing a pap due to having had one at another clinic so recent and she told me to only get it every 5 years even though breast cancer runs in my family(though I don’t have the gene).  I just decided to get the pap done with her since I didn’t want to disclose I went to another clinic for the pap where I had std testing since I don’t share those results with her.   I had a chlamydia or maybe a gonorrhea infection two years ago if that matters at all that I got from a man.   
Overall I’m wondering if I find out if this is hpv related after i do the additional testing or if I should have already been told ? "	0

"Do most people survive head and neck radiation? Hi guys,

My dad has his semi glosectomy soon. Clinical staging is T2N0M0.

I just wsnted to find out how survivability is amongst radiation treatment. All I've seen is horror stories and recently saw a documentary about someone who died due to complications from radiation therapy. Is this the case for most people?

I saw the America Cancer Society statistics and apparently survival for regional spread is 69% which id incredible yet all I see is horror stories and issues.

Just looking for some hope here. My dad's HPV negative and is 64 with diabetes, cholesterol, and a stent from years ago.

"Does anyone know what motivates the antivaxxers who aren't selling ""alternative health cures"" or similar?

I understand the motives of people like this.

I struggle to understand the antivaxxers who have a much smaller or no financial motive? Like why would a doctor give up a practice to lie about vaccines online just to sell a book that only makes what she would have by remaining a practicing physician. It doesn't make sense.

"Keen to vaccinate myself, but not my kids. Looking for opinions. The title might sound odd but let me explain. Im in education. I'm absolutely pro-vax. My kids have all their vaccines from the national vaccines programme and chickenpox/meningitis vaccines too.
 I was slightly sceptical of the speed with which the covid vax was produced initially and thought I'd hang back and see how things played out but get it eventually. Now, I'm so fed up with covid living that I'd happily take any vaccines available. 

My thinking is I'm done having kids, so wouldn't have to worry about long term effects to fertility or foetal health that hasn't yet been observable in vaccine studies so I'm happy to take the gamble for myself. For me, its only a toss up between covid side effects/death and vaccine side effects. 

 I have 2 kids though, and I'm worried about ramifications down the road for them. Could it cause fertility issues, or developmental ones when they hit their teens? They're both under 6. Can anyone open my thinking on this at all or have any opinions on which way I should go?"	1

"I'm cancer free with no radiation - read this before you decide on treatment! BLOT: I just completed treatment successfully for HPV+ SCC tonsil cancer without radiation. I want to help other people access this treatment and avoid the lifelong side effects of radiation. This treatment may or may not be appropriate for you, but please read my story before you agree to radiation – you may be able to avoid it too!

MY STORY: I am a 54F. In May 2024, I woke one morning to find a lump on my neck the size of a pecan. After a round of antibiotics, I was referred to an ENT at my regional hospital, scanned, biopsied, and diagnosed with HPV+ SCC cancer in my tonsil and 3 lymph nodes (T2 N1 M0). My case would be reviewed by their cancer board. My ENT talked with me for an hour about the variety of treatment options but said that he expected the recommendation to be radiation and chemo. He mentioned that he had trained with a surgeon at GWU Hospital in Washington DC who was using neoadjuvant (pre-surgery) chemo then TORS with great success and he wished he could offer that to me, however it was not yet “standard of care” and unavailable at my regional hospital. I asked, “Can I go there?”

While my ENT followed up with his DC colleague about my case, I decided to seek a second opinion at MD Anderson. They are like a cancer SWAT team and immediately assigned a team of specialists to my case. I met with surgical, radiation, and dental oncologists and had a slew of additional tests. The recommendation from their cancer board: radiation and chemo. I explained that I was still exploring other options, but they wanted to proceed full steam ahead, so I completed patient education, had a dental stint made, and underwent simulations for photon and proton radiation. The more I learned about radiation, the process, and its side effects, the more horrified I became.

Meanwhile, the surgeon in DC offered to take my case. He had used the chemo/surgery approach successfully for 10 years with similar outcomes to radiation and little or no long-term side effects. As luck would have it, he recently joined forces with the National Institutes of Health to conduct a study validating the treatment for acceptance in the broader medical community and to hopefully become the new standard of care. I was invited to come to DC for testing to determine if I was a candidate for the NIH study. I was.

Long story short (too late?): I chose door #2 – the NIH study and the DC surgeon. My arm of the study also includes an HPV vaccine to further improve long-term outcomes, so my first visit included dose #1 of the vaccine. I then had 3 rounds of chemo (Cisplatin and Docetaxel) at 3-week intervals, with additional doses of the vaccine the following weeks. I then completed TORS surgery and neck dissection for removal of my tonsil and 22 lymph nodes on 10/3. I received pathology results yesterday – the tonsil and all nodes tested negative, and I am CANCER FREE.

Why don’t other hospitals use this treatment when it works without the side effects? Because it is not recognized yet as standard of care by the academic community and insurance companies. Despite the years of data (from my surgeon and another in Canada), there had not yet been an official study, which is now underway. Also, those radiation machines don’t pay for themselves, so until there is broad recognition of success, hospitals aren’t motivated to change anything.

If you are interested in exploring this option for yourself, you can find details of the study here including contact information: [https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06223568](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06223568)

They are actively seeking participants, so just reach out! Eligible candidates must have HPV+ SCC stage 1-2 throat cancer which is typically in the tonsils or base of tongue (details in the link). Note that all testing, chemo, and vaccine treatments at the NIH are free. They also pay for airfare and a daily hotel stipend. Surgery is handled via your insurance. You may be able to receive the surgical care through a local surgeon as well.

I am thrilled to be both cancer free and to participate in the advancement of a treatment that will reduce so much future suffering. Feel free to message me or ask any questions here!"	0
Serious vaccination question So this is a serious question. If the vaccine does not stop me getting and spreading covid then why should I get it?	0
What would happen if one contracted COVID the same day as getting vaccinated? I got vaccinated 35 hours ago with my first dose of COVAXIN (an inactivated virus vaccine). Subsequently, I came in passing contact for a few seconds with someone who had COVID (RT-PCR confirmed). We were both masked, but considering the possibility that I was infected, what will be the likely outcome? I have not been previously infected and can't find any answers to my query online. Will I potentially have to face some very adverse reaction on account of my immune system going into overdrive by detecting these two separate but identical infections?	1

"HR HPV + CIN2/3 + microcarcinoma 1a1 

Hi ladies! May I ask your opinion on my following doubt please?
I have been hpv16 positive for many years, in June I had a Leep done for high grade dysplasia. They found 1mm microcarcinoma that didn’t affect the resection margins, the overall Margins of the entire tissue came focally affected by cin2/3. However, my pap came negative after less than 3 months following the LEEP. Had 2 pcr test in August and last week, both came negative for any HR HPV.

Here it goes my question, is it possible to have dysplasia (CIN2/3) but being HR HPV free/negative?"	0
"Why does PEP work? Total not medically educated so forgive my ignorance. I hope this is the place for my query as I see a lot of covid related stuff.

"California Senate Bill 276 Pro vaccine father here. California removed personal and religious exemption beliefs with SB 277 in 2015. Now, California is proposing another bill, SB 276, that will disqualify medical exemptions for all non-life threatening vaccine reactions. For example, if a child has seizures or temporary paralysis after receiving an injection, then that child will be forced to continue with their immunization schedule if they want to attend school. 

The politicians behind this bill say it’s all about going after doctors that hand out fake medical exemptions. That’s fine, I’m all for that. What I am torn about is that this same bill drastically narrows the scope of what side effects qualify for a medical exemption. Basically, children would need to have born with an autoimmune disease or prove they suffered permanent damage from a vaccine in order to receive a medical exemption from the State.  

How do you guys feel about this law?"	0
"Are COVID vaccine actually 100% effective against severe/deadly infections?

"Long term (3+yrs) Genital Warts, break through in treatment! So after doing all this treatment and sporadic bouts of cryo along the way still having HPV genital warts made me feel like I was doomed. The warts would often stay, or maybe recess just a bit before coming back. I was loosing hope. I had been in the worst spells of depression and shame over this. Doomed to never have sex again because I did not want to pass this curse on.

*TL;DR at the bottom.*

I wanted to share some hope with this community and share what I did to improve.

**Quick backstory:** 2018-2019 HPV Genital warts under my penis head. Along the foreskin in the back. It's never been too bad mostly contained to that area. Also the warts have been mostly little subtle bumps to the point where I wasn't even sure if they were warts till I got a skin biopsy. HIV negative and otherwise very healthy.

**Enter treatment. I won't bore you with the details but I've tried a lot. Some had varying effectiveness but nothing lasted.**

* Cryotherapy: standard treatment, totally inneffective on my warts for some reason. I must have had this done over 20+times at this point, but more positives on this later)
* Podophyllin: Applied by dermatologist. Sticky resin you need to washoff soon after it's applied. VERY effective. I'd say made me think my warts were totally gone but I had to discontinue treatment due to moving to a place where it wasn't legal.
* Podophyllin toxin: Was prescribed this after telling of my success with podophyllin. Was a cream to take home. I'd say be very careful with this stuff. It can cause dermatitis and between one and the last item I believe have kind of messed up a patch of my skin which is now very white.
* Imiquimod: This is a popular derma recommendation. I finally bit the bullet and bought it even though it's super expensive. Made me feel awful. Like I had the chills, fever. Package said to stop using it if you felt that way so I did. Didn't seem to do too much while I was using it.
* Veragen: Another cream. I did this one a lot and didn't really have much luck with it.
* HPV Vaccine. I had this recommended to me early in my diagnosis, but figured why do I need it if I already got it, plus its not cheap. All the info I got at the time told me it doesn't help with existing infections so I neglected it. But I heard some rumblings later on that it could possibly help. So I bit the bullet 1.5yrs back and over the course of a yr got all 3 gardasil shots. Looking back I wish I did it sooner.

So after doing all this treatment and sporadic bouts of cryo along the way still having HPV genital warts made me feel like I was doomed. The warts would often stay, or maybe recess just a bit before coming back. I was looing hope. I had been in the worst spells of depression and shame over this. Doomed to never have sex again because I did not want to pass this curse on.

Fast forward to a few months ago, I'm at a new dermatologist in my new city. I will keep fighting. We did the standard procedure with me catching him up on my treatments. He asked if I had the vaccine and I said yes. He said that was good and told me to consider supplementing with zinc. That was the first I heard about any kind of supplements being useful for HPV. So after my visit (and of course mandatory cryo pain) I went home and did some research on supplements and HPV. I found some journals that had suggested that supplementing with Zinc Sulfate had a positive impact on recovering from GW since people who had it were often at lower levels. Well shit, if that can help maybe there are others things too! So I went in and found a bit more data on b12 and folates potentially being helpful aswell. I figured I had little to lose at this point. I ordered some vit d and c just because.

The derma suggested I use imiquimod along with the cryo treatments. I was skeptical since I had such a bad experience with it before. But at this point I was willing to give it another go.

Unbelievably the warts started disappearing. I watched my penis turn to normal after just two cryo visits and 2 applications of imiquimod. I was stunned this was somehow working now. The only thing that has changed was the vaccine having a chance to settle (I'm about 6 months out from my third dose) and the supplements. There's still a few left but I'm confident they will be gone soon.

If I had to make a theory (not a doctor) I'm guessing the vaccine and the additional supplements gave my immune system the power it needed to fight off the warts. The cryo and imiquimod just showed the body where it needs to send the immune response. Obviously, just my theory.

So if you are experiencing warts that won't go away I can suggest you try what I did. I know its a lot and all these things are expensive and time consuming. I was reeling every step of the way. But tbh years in I would pay a lot more to get rid of this curse.

**Summary of what I did that worked.**

* Cryotheraphy (once every 2-4 weeks)
* Imiquimod (a few times a week, would make me feel sick so I used it a bit less than was recommended)
* Gardsil 9 Vaccine (all 3 shots)
* Supplements!! 
* \>Zinc Sulfate (most promising in literature)
* \>B12 and Folate (also potential to beneficial)
* \>Vitimin D and C. (didn't see studies suggesting they help but I thought why not, esp vitimin d)
* *managing stress and anxiety via meditation, letting go and therapy*

I don't believe it was any one thing I did but the totality of all of them working together.

TL;DR Had GW for 3+ going on 4yrs. Had every treatment under the sun and didn't have any success until I started taking supplements in addition to standard treatment.

***Edit: I would like to also point out I did a lot this year to manage my stress and anxiety since it has a huge play in how the immune system functions. I practiced meditation, the art of letting go, went to therapy. They all helped me in general and I'm also convinced helped my immune system. Also I am a 30y/o male for reference.***

**Edit2: I wanted to note I don't drink or smoke. Including weed. And I eat healthy and exercise. So that's why I was so perplexed about why this stuck around for so long. I suggest if you're not doing all those things already and your symptoms won't go away you do those things.**

I wish anyone out there suffering from this virus the best of luck. I know the depths of pain and darkness it can cause. I think almost all cases go away eventually, even if some take a lot long than others. Keep going and keep fighting, things will get better.

**Edit 3: 11/13/22 I've been getting a lot of DMs about my results after the fact so I just wanted to make a post here to make it more complete for anyone who finds this. After half a year+ of waiting (thank you canadian health care system) I had my appointment with the dermatologist. No HPV to be found! Its been a challenge getting back into having sex after so long but having someone who is patient and understanding really helps. Wish you all the best, don't give up!**"	1

"Positive LEEP Experience! So Much Anxiety Over NOTHING! Please Read If You're Scared! I really hope my experience can help put other women at ease, just like the sisters who wrote of their experiences on this Reddit before me! I came here in hopes of finding stories like mine, and now I will contribute to the positive outcomes here for other nervous women to read. 

40F. Quick Backstory: First abnormal pap EVER September 23. Colposcopy that I freaked out about early November. Came back Cin2/3 for HPV 16, despite having the original vaccine back when I was about 22.. Stressed all through holidays up to today's procedure. The past 3 days were particularly emotional. Spent a lot of time trying to get out of my persistent scary imaginative thoughts about the whole thing by being nice to myself and immersing into some games and good tv, took a bath.

Today I went in to my appoint in the mid afternoon. I appreciated a long morning to get myself awake, fed, and medicated. I decided to have my Paragard IUD removed after 5 years. They didn't initially tell me that it could be a problem, but I googled about it and found out that the strings often get cut in the procedure, which makes later removal potentially more difficult. I spoke about this with my doc, and she said it was best to remove it, as it can potentially create excess scar tissue build up due to the way the copper inflames those tissues, and that said scar tissue would likely fuse the strings and make it very unpleasant to remove later. So she prescribed misoprostol to take the night before and morning of the procedure to soften my servix for the IUD removal (she did this because I have not given birth and she wanted to make sure my cervix was dilated a little bit to make removal easier and less painful). I thought it would make me feel super rough but I honestly didn't notice any changes after taking it.

I also took a 1mg dose of Ativan  the night before and in the half hour before going to my appointment, which helped with my stress a lot, so I HIGHLY recommend asking your doc for this if you are having significant stress like I did.

Upon arrival, I find out that my nurse for the procedure is my my fiancé's cousin, which put me much more at ease. We don't really have much of a relationship yet, but I joked with her that this is our special bond now and we just have to get acquainted better now lol! Having a familiar face in there was very helpful. She held my hand and we all had a light, joking banter going on. This is always the thing that helps me most in times like this, so I was thankful to have this.

They had me put a big sticky grounding electrode pad on my right thigh and then I assumed the position. The doctor asked if I wanted to see the loop she was using and I said sure, which was helpful for me because it just looked like a little floss stick tool of some kind with a very thin wire. We also talked about what to expect post procedure and what is normal, what is not, and how to prevent infection. She was very gentle and sweet about it.

First step was to clamp things open and cousin held my hand while I got the first numbing shot. The thought of it was worse than the actual pain and it was helpful to squeeze her hand for the initial pinch. I had taken 2 extra Strength Tylenols on the way in so I know that probably helped. (getting my gums injected before a tooth procedure hurts me way worse than this did). They warned me that the epinephrine might make me feel antsy, but I never wound up feeling the racing-heartbeat everyone talks about. That was probably due to the Ativan. This was when she removed my IUD, which I thankfully barely felt (I had a very painful insertion experience, so I was relieved).

There was a machine they turned on that was a suction tool of some sort that just sounded like a white noise machine, and because I use one of those nightly, I was pretty much able to trick my brain into thinking that is what it was. The doc explained a bit of what she was doing while I had my eyes closed and tapped my hands gently on myself, which seemed to keep me distracted well enough. I was properly numbed and didn't feel any pain during the procedure. In fact, I was surprised when she pulled the speculum out seemingly so soon, and it truly was over before I knew it! I kept waiting for it to hurt, or to feel something unpleasant and I honestly never did. So I was very lucky! And the burning smell so many talk about, I only caught a faint whiff of it after I was already up and off the table, and its smelled a little like burnt hair. Didn't even phase me.

The most pain I felt during the whole ordeal was them pulling that electrode pad off my leg! It was like yanking off a big 6x4 hair wax pad. So I suggest shaving your legs before you go in, so you don't get all those hairs pulled on top of your skin lol. But honestly I don't think any hair got pulled out. It was just very stuck on there.

I have been chillin at home for a good 8 hours now, with very little discharge, and no pain. I have taken one dose of Advil, and am using medical weed gummies with 1:1 ratio of CBD to help with any swelling. Having a nap seemed to help as well. I am now hoping to have an easy weekend. I feel like I can move around fine, but I won't be doing anything strenuous, and tomorrow we are supposed to have a snowstorm, so I am happy to do nothing but watch old movies and eat whatever I feel like.

She said I only need to wait two weeks to have sex, use tampons, generally put things up there. But I see a lot of women on here saying 4-6 weeks, so I may just err on caution and take the longer route. She also suggested I use condoms for 6 months since it helps any remaining infection clear up even faster. Also so I don't get pregnant before the 6 month-fully healed mark. I am not sure if I will be having children, due to my age primarily, but I told her that in the hopes she would be conservative about the amount of tissue she took.

So TL:DR, I wasted way too much time and energy, and 3 full days ahead of this procedure worrying about what wound up being, honestly, one of the easier medical procedures I've been through. All of my pain and nightmare fears of this never came to pass, and now I feel a bit silly. Of course it's scary because a piece of me was removed, but because I didn't feel anything or see anything, it barely even feels like it happened. But I know that my concern caused me to do very important preparation steps that I personally highly suggest:

\- Talk to your doctor about removing the IUD if it's something you feel ok about doing (you can always get it put back in when you heal back up!) Despite the risks, I had been told I could just leave it in and didn't find out about the potential risks until AFTER I did my OWN research and started that conversation with her myself.  Make sure to let them know at least a couple days before your appointment in case you need the cervix softening meds.

\- ask your doc for anti-anxiety meds beforehand if you are stressed about this at all. there is really no need to suffer unnecessarily! The stress I felt within myself in the days leading up was the absolute worst part of this entire ordeal. 

\- Make sure to take extra strength Tylenol a half hour before going in. This is a huge help to not feel the numbing shot.

\- Make small talk with your nurse/doc, or bring headphones. Practice simple mental distraction techniques before you go in. Hell, bring one of those fidget popper things, that would have been nice too.

&#x200B;

I will add more if I think of more helpful details, and fee free to ask more questions below or PM me. If you are scared of this, you are NOT alone, and you are very valid in being scared! But I really hope you end up having a smooth experience such as I did, and now that I have done it, I can say that any woman who needs this done can certainly handle it, and the relief of knowing those shitty dangerous cells are just GONE is the MOST relaxed I have felt in 4 months! The relief is the absolute best part."	0

"Why do so many anti vaxxers say things like ''Covid has a death rate of 0.XXX%'' ''My risk of dying of covid = 0.00...%''? As if we actually can believe any of the damn statistics anyway? Even people like Del Bigtree and others will throw out numbers from government stats for survival rate. With all the PCR test nonsense, with all the with covid/ from covid nonsense, with all the pandemic policies that depleted our immune systems and health over 2020/21 (and the vaccine for extra in 21-23), with all the midazolam/morphine/remdesivir/ventillator deaths and all the hospital closures and all of the rest of it... How on EARTH can we pretend to say that any of these stats are DAMN reliable anyway?  


OF all the people, you'd expect anti vaxxers here and people like Del Bigtree or McCullough or Joe Rogan to be skeptical of the official figures.   


My opinion is.. We have no clue what the CFR was, we have no clue how low risk it was, (although we know clearly most people under 65 weren't dying or getting very sick, we do know that) we have no clue what even was the virus'(viruses?) doing and what was our own self inflicted wounds that were making us more vulnerable to the viruses or simply causing people to die and get really sick irrespective of a virus.   


Some of the same people even doubt the virus exists at all, yet still say ''why would I get a vaccine for a virus that has a 0.001% fatality rate).  


And to add... often the numbers we hear in these statements are often just 0.1% or 0.05%, which actually.. you say that's not deadly, but 0.1% would be pretty deadly really.. 1/1000 people dying from a virus is pretty concerning.   


I don't think we can reliably assess what really happened during covid, and what really caused deaths, and how much really was the virus or how much was our own doing, and what really could have been prevented too.. because heck, lets say we know for sure that covid had a 0.01% death rate for under 65, then that's not even necessarily true.. Now that sounds paradoxical and weird, but it's not just about what we DID in 2020-21, but what we didn't do! what if that 0.01%, as accurate as it is, could have been 0.0001% had we used certain treatments and dealt with the whole thing differently?  


There is no such thing as a fixed fatality rate of a virus, because it changes from person to person, from time period to time period, from conditions to other conditions and so on.. it is not a fixed thing at the best of times when it's not a novel situation. "	0
"Dr Arani - saved my dang life- HPV gone forever - it’s been almost 2 1/2 years. 60-80 gw, removed on the spot. Dr Arani from Los Angeles removed 100% of the gw I had with his “BCR Treatment”. It was expensive, but those was more than a year and a half ago. I think 2 1/2 years now. 

I know what you are going through. It’s like a dark cloud over everything. I couldn’t sleep, I felt dirty when I’d get out of the shower, or relax, or anything. To be honest I was going to kill my self, I had made my mind up. HPv ruined my life at the time...lost the girl I truly loved (even though she stayed with me for over a year during it) etc. 

I wish I had gone to doctor Arani sooner.

Listen guys, make an appointment with him.
The BCR cost me around 6000 over all.
However, it is GONE now. That was about a year and a half ago.
Had only 1 or 2 pop up, gone back to him, he did them basically for free.

I’ve been free of HPV gw ever since Dr Arani, he saved my life.

I am a real person. There was no insane scarring or whatever else these people have said.

Give the area 2 weeks to heal. Get the HPV vaccine. Don’t smoke cigarettes. Weed is ok after his treatment.

I’ve tried everything before. Cryo (they just come back), Imiquimod (was mental hell putting it on - had no effect what so ever). Had someone straight up clip them off. Was all useless / they would come back. I was living in hell.

Dr Arani SAVED MY LIFE. I am posting this for you, not for me, I’m already free.

Do an appointment with Dr Arani. If you want, I’ll even answer questions about my experience - I’ll have to check back on this post though.

I promise you, Dr Arani helped me. It almost seems like the negative posts are sometimes lies about him? 
His treatment (BCR) works. 

“Dr Arani Medical Center Los Angeles” Google that and you’ll find him."	1
"The Covid vaccine side effect sub is quarantined, that makes no sense  The Covid vaccines are experimental in every sense of the word, there should be every support for people who suffer from side effects.

Yet the vaccinelonghaulers sub is quarantined. That's like quarantining subs for people who have HIV or cancer, it's absurd.

We spent over a year of denying that the vaccines were affecting periods, despite many women on Reddit reporting on it, until it was finally confirmed just recently. It proves people have a reason to discuss this, yet they have to do so in a walled of area of the site."	-1

"Eighteen foundational falsehoods of vaccine safety and effectiveness, presented by the CDC themselves! So this is a long read, but it's very important to read, if you want to know what CDC really is. 

I, an 18 year old, was looking into the CDCs statistics, to find out data about how many people died, get, and now die, from measles, and the complications it causes, and I was flabbergasted at what I was reading... False information, manipulated, sneaky, contradictory, and outright INSANE and inaccurate data. 

Here's what I discovered: 

[https://www.cdc.gov/measles/downloads/MeaslesDataAndStatsSlideSet.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/downloads/MeaslesDataAndStatsSlideSet.pdf)

&#x200B;

First inaccuracy:

''Great progress has been made towards measles elimination''

Well not really, firstly, measles can do more damage to vaccinated people because there immune systems are weaker than naturally immune people who have already had measles, either when they were a baby, or a kid, when there immune system is strong, or assisted by breast milk. Vaccinated people take longer to recover from measles, (and yes 10% (admitted by CDC) of vaccinated children are not protected at all, (and yet you blame unvaccinated kids for spreading diseases, 10% of vaccinated people may as well be considered unvaccinated)), and since vaccines are put into the bloodstream, when measles comes through a natural method, such as through the gut, or lungs, the body will not only have the measles for the second time, (since the vaccine already gave them essentially measles) meaning they could have standard measles on top of vaccine strain measles, but will also have possible vaccine induced immunocompromisation, which would result in a less efficient fighting off of the disease.

&#x200B;

Secondly, by ''Great'' I suppose they would be suggesting that overall, the vaccine program was a success, but if they have not done any placebo, or control studies, to show vaccines are overall benefiting, and are not dangerous and doing more harm than good, then to say this, is an unsubstantiated claim.

Those in scientific and medical fields frequently demand well-designed studies, like double-blinded, randomized,  placebo-controlled trials, so why not apply that same requirement to vaccines? Why hasn’t anybody ever done that study, except small independently funded ones that have little access to resources and data. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Second inaccuracy:

''From 2000-2016\*:•Reported measles incidence decreased 87%, from 145 to 19 cases per million persons

•Annual estimated measles deaths decreased 84% (20.4 million deaths prevented)''

&#x200B;

So, if we take the average between 145 - 19, maybe 80.. So, take 100 for easy maths and an estimation, there's around 7000\* bigger for 7 billion people, so lets time 100 by 7000, we get 700,000, meaning 700,000 cases of measles, I'm going to guess, over a period of a month? So lets times that by 12, that's 8,300,000 cases per year.. (That kind of sounds too much but I'll stick with it) that's 8.3 mil x 16 years, so 132 million cases in 16 years, we'll knock that down to 100million because of overestimation.

&#x200B;

So, lets say that without the vaccine, that number would be 87% higher, meaning 187million cases would have occurred.

&#x200B;

So they claim that 20.4million out of 187million cases would have resulted in death. That's a rate of 1/9 cases = death.

&#x200B;

The CDC literally admitted, that in 1950s, before vaccines were introduced, measles caused death in 1/1000 cases.

Yet incredibly, and astoundingly, they claim in 2000-2016 that 1/9 cases would have caused death, without the vaccine?

That's a 100x exaggeration for 1950s, so fuck knows what that is for 2000s and 2010s...

This is insanity, people are buying into the CDC, making 150x exaggerated claims!

It's purely asinine! It's fucking scary.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Third inaccuracy:

The graph on page 3. 

So this graph says that 20.4million deaths were prevented by vaccines. So, I counted the number of deaths over 16 years, which was around 4-4.5 million, and the number of deaths, they presumably expected had the vaccine not been used, so 550,000 per year for 16 years which = 9million, now lets do the MATH, that's 5 million deaths prevented at BEST. Not 20.4 million.

&#x200B;

 Now, on TOP of this, how the hell, did they determine what the number of deaths per year would have been had the vaccine not been used? Did they do a placebo test? Did they look at an alternate universe where it was not used?

It's absolutely impossible to determine how many of those deaths reduced due to vaccines, and how many would have been reduced anyway. 

And on top of THAT, measles deaths were decreasing on trend, significantly, way way before the MMR was introduced, and had been for many dozens if not hundreds of years.

&#x200B;

This is absolutely shocking, complete data falsification, made up facts, and all it takes is 10 minutes of reading to figure out the lies. They don't expect people who are skeptical and critical to come along and read it though. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Fourth inaccuracy:

''U.S. Measles Burden: Before 1963 Vaccine Development\* 

Each year, measles caused an estimated 3 to 4 million cases

Close to 500,000 cases were reported annually to CDC, resulting in:

48,000 hospitalizations

1,000 cases with encephalitis (brain swelling)

450 to 500 deaths''

&#x200B;

So, here they start off by saying, measles caused 3-4million cases, in the US, before vaccines.

Then the next line says, 500,000 cases were reported annually, (which I admit could be because not all were reported, but they didn't consider this when looking at the symptoms).

&#x200B;

So, the 48,000 hospitalizations, how did they determine that these weren't out of the whole country? Not just the 500,000 reported? This could be 48,000/3,000,000 not 48,000/500,000.

Also, hospitalizations were not necessarily bad, sometimes it was just people being forced to get vaccinated, or treated, because it was thought necessary, or encouraged, for unreasonable reasons. 

&#x200B;

Then, 1,000 cases of encephalitis (again 1000/500,000 or 3-4million? Hmm I wonder), which ironically, is potentially the result of vaccine injury, and since vaccines can sometimes give you measles anyway, and vaccine injury can sometimes be diagnosed (with bias) as measles injury, as the symptoms can often crossover, it wouldn't be unreasonable to think that many of these cases were vaccine related anyhow. And since they inject aluminum into your blood, which can absorb into your lymphatic system, which takes white blood cells (which could be carrying aluminum) to the swollen parts of the brain, then as the brain lets in the blood cells, bypassing the blood brain barrier, and we know aluminum can cause many brain problems, which have been tested in rats, and found in human brains after death, in people who were autistic, brain damaged, paralyzed and other things.. then we know that it's reasonable to at least require some extensive study into this, to find out for certain what problems this could be causing, and what could be causing these problems.

&#x200B;

Now here's where it gets even more mind boggling:

It says 400-500 deaths per 500,000 or 4million (it doesn't state) but either way, it's either 1/1000 cases = death, or 1/8000 cases = death. IN 1950-60s!

So, on page 7, they say that in current time, 1-2/1000 cases result in death. The problem here is, that's in 2016, and if that's 2016, why is 1950-1960 less likely to die from measles than today? Did measles become more deadly, are vaccines making measles more deadly like I mentioned earlier? Or, the only other possibility is, that, this data, is entirely MADE UP.

&#x200B;

Lets look at the facts, in the past 10 years, in the US, maybe a couple thousand cases of measles have occured.. Okay, so that must mean that 2 have died, well, only 1 has, so that 1-2 is just exaggeration, and also,  if 1 person has died from measles out of 2000 cases, how could you possibly determine the average death rate from ONE example to go by?

&#x200B;

If in 1950 the death rate was 1/1000-1/8000 so, say 1/5,000, and that was with data of 400-500 deaths per year, then who in their right mind would think that having 1 example to go on, is enough information to claim that measles kills more people today by rate, than it did in 1950? Is that evidence that vaccines made measles more deadly? Or that they're making shit up? I think the latter.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Fifth inaccuracy:

''Measles was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000 thanks to a highly effective vaccination program and other control measures. ''

&#x200B;

Measles was never eradicated, it was made out to be, but never was, it was present in 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003, and those were the lowest years in the past 20, and who knows if this was just arbitrary, or whether the vaccine really was the reason.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Sixth inaccuracy:

''However, measles remains present in many other countries and can be brought into the United States by unvaccinated travelers (Americans or foreign visitors). 

•This can result in outbreaks that are costly to control.''

&#x200B;

Firstly, they admit themselves, that vaccinated people can be unprotected, at the rate of 1/10, and it is proven that vaccines don't eliminate infection, only development. Vaccinated people are admittedly contagious, and you could argue that since vaccinated people don't know they are, and aren't generally seen as so, as it's not common knowledge that vaccinated people are contagious too, then this means vaccinated people are a greater risk to spreading disease to vulnerable people, because unvaccinated people who are infected, have symptoms, and know they are ill, they (now days) stay away from others, and therefore are not likely to spread diseases. 

&#x200B;

Hospital signs in cancer wards and the like, say ''If you were vaccinated within 30 days, stay out of this ward'' and I wonder why this is? Is vaccine shedding really a myth? Or is a fabricated myth that in reality is so true hospitals literally put signs up saying it is.

&#x200B;

Outbreaks are also not that costly to control, but are costly to report, and spread propaganda on, and often are forcefully  made costly as means to make out measles is as bad as they possibly can make it out to be, if they can add cost to it, then they can claim it costs the government money, but it doesn't need to. That's the point, it's not necessary for it to cost money, it can cost virtually nothing and no problems will further arise.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Seventh inaccuracy: 

''Measles elimination is a global problem.''

A greater problem however, is malaria, and this is not nearly as talked about, and reported on. The U.S has more cases of malaria, than measles, yet measles is reported on and talked about 50 times more than malaria. 

&#x200B;

Measles is a problem, but it's a mild problem, not very serious, and is not problematic enough to rush a vaccine program without safety testing, to rush vaccines down peoples throats as fast as possible over, and to not think about whether putting measles into people, unnaturally, is a good way to stop measles from getting into people, naturally.. And not just a great way of introducing unnecessary health problems, death, and serious injuries, in preference for money, feeling of human accomplishment, sense of security and comfort, all by wishful thinking, appeals to peoples emotions, and fear tactics.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Eighth inaccuracy: 

''Encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) 1 per 1,000 cases''

&#x200B;

Wait so you mean to tell me that encephalitis from measles rose from 1000/3,000,000-4,000,000 cases to 1000/1,000,000 cases between 1950-60 and 2016?

&#x200B;

Hmm lets see, what could possibly cause a rise in encephalitis? Well, how about that thingy that has toxic chemicals that are put into the lymphatic system? Oh wait, I don't need to say this, it already says it on the vaccine INSERT. 

&#x200B;

The pharmaceutical companies already admit countless side effects and injuries ranging from death to seizures, comas, allergic reactions, meningitis, encephalitis, allergy developments, asthma, atopic eczema, allergic rhinitis, disabling asthma, immunocompromised disorders, and so many other things I couldn't fit here. Who knows what they're not admitting.

This is the same companies that had to remove their mmr 1 vaccine because it was causing meningitis, and vioxx because it was causing heart attacks and disease. When will they remove the next one, and what reason? 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ninth inaccuracy:

''As many as one out of every 20 children with measles gets pneumonia, the most common cause of death from measles in young children.''

&#x200B;

In that case then, why, in 1960, was pneumonia the cause of 30/100,000 deaths in the US? And in 1998, it was the cause of 30/100,000 deaths in the US, in ALL AGE groups.

&#x200B;

No change, but after 3-4 decades of vaccine usage, the supposed 1/20 cases of pneumonia in kids should have in turn resulted in a decrease of pneumonia cases significantly.

Let's look at the cases in children under 12, [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200005113421904](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200005113421904).

They had been going down steadily for a long time before vaccines were introduced, and the vaccine introduction seemed to have NO effect whatsoever. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Tenth inaccuracy: Labelled severe complications:

''•About one child out of every 1,000 who get measles will develop encephalitis (swelling of the brain) that can lead to convulsions and can leave the child deaf or with intellectual disability.

•For every 1,000 children who get measles, one or two will die from it''

&#x200B;

Now again, how did they determine that the encephalitis was caused by the measles, and not a result of another vaccine, or the very vaccine used to 'prevent' measles? If the children weren't at all vaccinated, then, again, I'd like to know why on earth was the rate of encephalitis from measles before the vaccine introduction was 1000/3-4million and is now 1000/1,000,000.. Also, if measles is soo uncommon now, at a few thousand cases over 20 years, then how did they determine that 1/1000 got encephalitis? There's barely any data to look at..

&#x200B;

Again I've already addressed the second bullet point, it's an unsubstantiated, unfounded, and demonstrably evidently false claim.

In the 50s and 60s, 500/3-4million died, and yet suddenly, now days, with the betterment of health, hygiene, diet (generally), education, technology, treatment, medical knowledge on preventing death, and other factors, that the death rate is suddenly higher? And again, 1-2, yet the only data suggests only 1. Pure exaggeration and fear mongering.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Eleventh inaccuracy:

•Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a very rare, but fatal disease of the central nervous system that results from a measles virus infection acquired earlier in life. SSPE generally develops 7 to 10 years after a person has measles, even though the person seems to have fully recovered from the illness. Since measles was eliminated in 2000, SSPE is rarely reported in the United States.

•Among people who contracted measles during the resurgence in the United States in 1989 to 1991, 4 to 11 out of every 100,000 were estimated to be at risk for developing SSPE. The risk of developing SSPE may be higher for a person who gets measles before they are two years of age. 

&#x200B;

Again, how do we know that this is exclusively caused by wild measles? Is it even possible that injecting almost wild measles, into your bloodstream, which is closely linked to your nervous system, could be, without even having the measles fully blown and spread across the body, causing SSPE as well?

It's just not enough to say that vaccines prevent these things, without demonstrating that vaccines don't also cause these things, and finding out how often it does, if so.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Twelfth inaccuracy: 

Page 9) These measles cases, are not just measles that unvaccinated people have gotten, but, for example in the rockland county 'outbreak' 1/3 of the people who got the measles, were vaccinated.  


&#x200B;

Thirteenth inaccuracy:

Page 12) 40,000 + 30,000 + 10,000 + 57,000 + 5,000 + 142,000 (\*per person, worked out roughly) =   

284 ÷ 6 = 47.3333333333. 

What on earth could possibly cost 50 grand per person, when you get measles?

&#x200B;

If this is true, then in 1950s, people must have spent the equivalent of 200,000,000,000 + increase due to the less availability of medical care, expenses of there being less doctors and nurses, and less knowledge on how to treat the diseases.

So we're talking maybe 300 billion dollars a year? Are you out of your mind CDC? 300 billion dollars were spent per year in the 50s just for measles cases? 

&#x200B;

Bull shit if you ask me. I'd say possibly a 10 - 150 million per year, were spent, not 300 fucking billion.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Fourteenth inaccuracy:

''Measles is due to failure to vaccinate. Case investigations are very resource-intensive.''  

No, you have not demonstrated measles is solely due to failure to vaccinate, it could be the failure of vaccines, the failure of making people aware that vaccine shedding is a REAL thing that REALLY causes measles to spread, and that full blown measles can be gotten by an MMR vaccine. 

&#x200B;

They also admit here, that the reason it's expensive when outbreaks happen, is the investigations are resource-intensive, but that's not unvaccinated peoples fault, you don't have to spent tons of money to investigate measles and report on it, only if you want to spread lies, propaganda, and repair peoples filter bubbles so they can continue to think measles is awful, vaccines are safe, and well tested, and vaccines are GOOD and BENEFICIAL, when they are not tested, and don't even need to be. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Fifteenth inaccuracy:

''•Luckily we have safe and effective vaccines that can prevent much of this burden, and we should not lose sight of the many successes that have been achieved.

•Modeling estimated that, among children born during 1994–2013, vaccination will prevent an estimated 322 million illnesses, 21 million hospitalizations, and 732,000 deaths over the course of their lifetimes, at a net savings of $295 billion in direct costs and $1.38 trillion in total societal costs. 

•Additional successes include the fact that outbreaks since measles elimination have generally been limited (in both size & number of generations)''

&#x200B;

No, vaccines are not effective, and are admitted to be dangerous, admitted to cause shedding, admitted to cause measles, admitted to have literally hundreds of mild to severe side effects. 

&#x200B;

Measles is not a burden, it's a slight inconvenience, like a shitty cold. Measles is actually proven to be overall benefiting to health, this is UNDISPUTED in the medical sciences, measles lowers risk of heart disease, and some cancers, (don't quote me on this, but it has health benefits that are agreed upon by virtually all scientists in the field).

Measles, even in the first world war, was virtually harmless, only killed 1/800 people or so, and was already becoming naturally endangered, and by the 50s, and 60s, measles was something which families would get together and purposely give to their children, so that they would get it and be immune for life. 

This is PROVEN science, agreed upon by all non bias, scientists who don't have conflicts of interest.

&#x200B;

''vaccines will prevent.... 732,000 deaths over the course of their lifetimes,'' (1994 - 2013 born children).

We already know this is undetermined, made up propaganda. They don't know how many lives vaccines saved, they CAN'T know, they haven't done a placebo or any study with a control group, they also don't even consider that A. Deaths were plummeting, plenty of time before vaccines were even considered. B. That vaccines could EASILY be causing more deaths than it's saving, and this needs to be investigated, it's not fair to not show that vaccines are doing overall good to the health, and lives of people. It's evil.

&#x200B;

''•Additional successes include the fact that outbreaks since measles elimination have generally been limited (in both size & number of generations)''

Well this is just a tautology, yes, we know vaccines reduced cases of wild measles, you don't have to put it in such a strange manner.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Sixteenth inaccuracy: 

''Elimination has been achieved & maintained for 15 years''

Wait, but there's been 2000 cases in the past 15 years.. 

And elimination of a bomb, by blowing up the bomb, is not an achievement by any means. It's fighting a house fire, by transporting it to the neighbors and saying ''look we stopped your house from burning down!'' and yet, in this situation, we don't even know whether there's still fire in the kitchen, we only checked the bedroom.. No one has even walked in to check whether or not they stopped the fire, or whether or not the hose water is acid or just water. And when someone asks to check in the house, the firefighters say ''NO it's UNETHICAL TO GO IN THERE!''.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Seventeenth inaccuracy:

''The vaccine works and the disease is recognizable which makes eradication both possible & achievable.''

Not really true, measles has been so rare, that doctors have forgotten how to accurately and reliably identify measles, most of the doctors today weren't even doctors when measles was common.

&#x200B;

The vaccine doesn't 'work', it has - worked, and can, work, but it doesn't necessarily work full stop. We don't even know whether measles is evolving to be unaffected by vaccines, quicker than the vaccines can evolve. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Eighteenth inaccuracy:

Page 15) This is just an advertisement, CDC is selling you a product, not regulating products, the people who work for CDC, are sometimes have a conflict of interest, given to them or offered to them by pharmaceutical companies, and this is factually correct, if you look at the news, and see how many examples of this actually happening. The regulatory foundations are not really regulating, they're assisting in selling a product.

They finish off, claiming unfounded statements, that measles is spread by unvaccinated people, but this is factually incorrect, on many levels I have already talked about.

&#x200B;

Lastly, here's an analogy I think works for the pro vaxxer - anti vaxxer question, which is ''You're putting your child at risk, why?'' ''Why are you letting your kid die?'' ''You know your kids won't live long, you are a murderer!''

&#x200B;

Here it is: (It's hypothetical somewhat).

&#x200B;

There's person A (unvaccinated person), with a piece of string attached from their hand to their heart, which is 20CM long, and if removed, will have reasonable chance of killing them, if they break it. They also have 100$ in their hand.

&#x200B;

There's person B says, ''Give me the money in your hands! Or I'll stab you with this plastic knife!''.

&#x200B;

If person A dies from a stab wound, they did not kill themselves. Pro vaxxers would say they did."	-1

"why did the left latch on to ""trusting the science"" so much? why did the whole vaccine thing become a political showboating competition? 

lefties were like showing off their vaccine status, showing off how much they trust scientists and institutions. And tried to shame people who didn't trust the safety of the vaccines.

right wing people and alt right said the vaccine was a conspiracy theory and latched on to the conspiracy that all vaccines are bad even tho this one was only dangerous because it was pretty experimental at that stage.

I don't understand why people latched on to the vaccine thing and dug their feet in so hard. what do they have to gain? 

if you think the vaccine is good, take it. 
if you think it's a conspiracy, don't take it...

idk what they have to gain from showboating about it and trying to convert other people to being a scientist trusting sheep, or anti vaxer."	0
Getting the Vaccine and worried for my husband who is anti-vax I scheduled my vaccine (finally) for tomorrow. I wanted to wait till it was FDA approved so I am going behind my parents and husbands backs and getting it. I was just wondering if I get the vaccine (I know it has the virus in it) will I put my husband at risk for catching it because it is in my system? He isn’t anti-vaccine for anything besides this vaccine because it’s so new and especially with social media being so weird these days he’s too scared to get it or let me get it but I can’t let myself not get it. It’s too silly to just expect this virus to go away unless I do my part. Will I get him sick?	1

So I'm not pro disease if I want better vaccines, less unnecessary vaccines, and other ways of defeating disease."	-1

"Encounter with an anti-vaxxer while getting a flu shot I was taking my youngest daughter to CVS for a flu shot where I ran into an anti-vaxxer mother. The dialogue went something like this.

> Lady: Why are you injecting your daughter with poison? Do you know what's in those shots.


> Me: It's probably less dangerous than my tap water. 


> Lady: Do you want her to catch autism?


> My daughter: What's autism?


> Lady: A disease triggered by vaccines. Poor little things. They're constantly moody, feeling hopeless for weeks at a time, are slow, and can't control themselves.


> My daughter: What are your sources?


> Lady: The internet


> My daughter: Not everything on the internet is true. I could easily edit Wikipedia. Better check your sources to see if they're reliable.


With that, we went in to get the shot.

"Is it possible to determine who gave me HPV based on timing? I was with a partner and married for 9.5 years. In June of 2023 caught him talking to women online (and had been for 8 years) but I don't know if he went any further in real life. I found evidence of him trying, but no solid evidence he succeeded. He lied about a lot of things and never readily admitted anything. We did not use physical protection during sex. 

After we separated I had one brief fling where we used a condom, and since then I have been in a monogamous relationship with someone else where we have not used physical protection. Before me my current partner did not have sexual contact with anyone for 4 years.

Last week I had a pap and came back positive for low risk HPV.

I understand it doesn't really matter where it came from in the grand scheme of things and it's incredibly common. I'm not super hung up on the stigma of it, I promise. But as part of my ?healing journey? after my discovery of infidelity and subsequent divorce I would like to know if it was my ex cheating and putting me at risk. 

I'm the kind of person where ambiguity will haunt me, regardless of ""if it matters"" .. if that makes sense. "	0
"My son had his 4yo vaccines yesterday. And then he had an immediate reaction to them.  See, he abruptly developed severe, acute ice cream deficiency.

Fortunately, there was an ice cream parlor across from his pediatrician’s office, so we were able to promptly replete his ice cream levels.

As a result of these vaccines, he will never be able to tell his children how awful it was when he suffered from measles, mumps, or chickenpox.  He will never infect his pregnant partner with rubella and devastate his unborn child.  He will never be paralyzed by polio.  He won’t cough for months because of pertussis, die of diphtheria, or break bones because of tetanus.

And I, as a pediatrician and a father, am so relieved and grateful that these vaccines exist."	-1
"what evidence do we have that (booster) vaccines protect others and slow the spread? This question is specifically aimed at showing how asking high quantities of a population to take the vaccine stops the spread at a population level.

I would assume the following things to be relevant

1. chance of people who get infected that are vaccinated
2. chance of then infecting others, modulated by length of illness, viral load and symptoms (coughing)
3. how good the immunity is from infection + vaccine, i.e. how often vaccinated people get reinfected vs unvaccinated

Im asking this because its pretty frustrating that people always pull a specific country with high vaccination rates and high cases and then say young people getting the vaccine doesnt help others at all. I have the suspicion that their view is limited, but I would like to see evidence or more professional perspectives on the matter :)"	1
"My journey with Omicron. Sometime in December, my father came home with COVID. He was coughing, hacking and self-medicating with whiskey. I got sick, but thought it was just a cold, so two days later, I went out with my friends. Big mistake.

I could not stop hacking and coughing. Bear in mind that I just finished chemo and radiation and had the two vaccine doses plus the booster. I would have no realization how those shots saved my life! 

By December 26th, I was admitted into the ER for hacking and coughing. I was given the COVID swab test and one day after I got discharged, I got the results. I was positive. With Omicron so I didn't qualify for those mononuclear antibodies.

After antibiotics didn't work, I went back to the ER, this time, being whisked away from my mother and put into the COVID ward of the ER. No privacy except for curtains and I was given a full breakfast, but after choking, they changed the menu to minced after getting me into a room.

For the better part of a week, I hacked and coughed. I never left my small hospital room and never left my bed except to go to the washroom. I was on supplemental oxygen and had to either use a nasal cannula or be on a full oxygen mask. Fun times. At least I had WiFi and my phone and tablet to keep me occupied. I watched Encanto, WandaVision and Squid Game (again).

Discharge day came and I was so dazed and out of it. I was given prescriptions for meds like Remdesivir to help me get over COVID. I'm home now and still a bit dizzy, but otherwise fine.

Get vaccinated. It's better to get the vax and recover in the hospital than it is not to get it and die in the hospital."	1
"hospital I visited the hospital for my injury. I had to sign so much digital paperwork, just to talk about the cut on my toe! I'm going to have a hospital bill mailed to me.

&#x200B;

The doctor was cute and beautiful as ever. She was so smart too! She gave me some jelly that I'll be applying for the next few days. She said that the injury has recovered a good amount, and that I don't need to wrap or cover it unless I'm active. She also gave me band-aids.

&#x200B;

She recommended that I take a vaccine, but I didn't want to. It's usually wise to follow the advice of a doctor, but I've heard quite bad stuff about vaccines. I think vaccines can sometimes go bad, and some vaccination can actually lead to serious disease. Also, I didn't want the vaccine added to my bill. I've had cuts before, so I was confident that I didn't need it.

&#x200B;

While walking home, I was thinking of an ingenious idea: I can get food from the distant healthy store delivered to me, while I recover from the injury. It would be expensive, but I feel it's necessary. I can't keep eating unhealthy food for weeks.

&#x200B;

The injury isn't crippling, but I don't want to accidentally re-open it or cause an infection through sweat or dirt. Had my injury been anywhere else on my body, I probably wouldn't care so much. But I can't risk a foot infection. My feet are so important! They are my main means of affordable fitness and travel.

&#x200B;

there are two local stores near me, but their food isn't that healthy. I bought food from both stores, these past weeks. In one of the stores, I think 99% of its stock is expired. Some of its food items are open, probably by thieves. The store doesn't have fat free milk, apparently. The food items aren't priced, so I can't even budget. the other local store dominantly sells junk food that's high in added sugar, saturated fat, and sodium. Its fruits are usually expired. Most of it's healthy items are expired or overpriced. And it doesn't have fat free milk either."	-1
"How to keep mental health during HPV infection? * Remember that you are not alone.

> HPV infections are so common that nearly all men and women will get at least one type of HPV at some point in their lives. Most people never know that they have been infected and may give HPV to a sex partner without knowing it. Nearly 80 million Americans are currently infected with some type of HPV. About 14 million people in the United States become newly infected each year. [source](https://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/stdfact-hpv.htm)

* You are not dirty or worse than other people. Other people just don't know bout their active or previous infections.

* Calm down. Don't stress yourself. Be patient.

> ""Women who reported self-destructive coping strategies, like drinking, smoking cigarettes or taking drugs when stressed, were more likely to develop an active HPV infection,"" said principal investigator Anna-Barbara Moscicki, MD, FAAP, chief of the Division of Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine and professor of pediatrics at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Medicine. ""We also found that women who were depressed or perceived themselves to have lots of stress were more likely to have HPV persistence,"" she said, adding that this study is the first to show these connections between stress and HPV persistence. [source](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160430100243.htm)

* See this video about HPV infections: https://youtu.be/KOz-bNhEHhQ

* Stop reading random pages and sources about HPV. There is lots of misinformation and scary stories. 

* Stick to reliable websites, for example: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt05-hpv.html) or [McGill](https://www.mcgill.ca/traphpv/hpvfacts).

* Remember that 64% infections clear within 6 months, 80% within 12 months. 

> When researchers looked at the 10 most prevalent types of HPV, they noted 36% of prevalent infections persisted after six months, 20% persisted to 12 months, 13% persisted to 18 months and 9% persisted to 24 months (95% CI for all). [source](

* Remember that HPV is not for life.

> Most HPV infections in young men and women are transient, lasting no more than one or two years. Usually, the body clears the infection on its own. It is estimated that the infection will persist in only about 1% of women. It is those infections that persist which may lead to cancer. There is some research that suggests that the virus can hide deep in the affected mucosa or skin for several years, below detectable levels. These are called “latent” infections. Having an HPV-positive test followed by an HPV-negative test might mean two different things: that the virus has been completely cleared by the body, or that the level of infection is so small that laboratory tests cannot detect it. Thus, HPV might “reappear” several years after an infection (whether or not it was treated) when the immune system weakens (because of aging, pregnancy, illness, etc.) and then cause lesions. It is unknown what proportion of HPV infections go latent, nor what proportions are truly cleared by the body.

https://mcgill.ca/traphpv/hpvfacts

* If you have CIN then calm down too:

>HPV infection is necessary but not sufficient to develop CIN. More than 90% of infections are spontaneously cleared by the immune system within one year without treatment. Approximately 60% of CIN 1 lesions regress without treatment and less than 1% progress to cancer. However, it is estimated that 5% of CIN 2 and 12% of CIN 3 cases will progress to invasive cancer if untreated. In general, it takes 10 to 20 years for CIN to progress to cancer, allowing a significant time period for detection and treatment. Progression from CIN to cancer requires persistent HPV infection.

> Co-factors associated with persistent HPV infection and progression of disease include smoking, HIV infection, and other types of immunosuppression.

https://www.cancertherapyadvisor.com/home/decision-support-in-medicine/obstetrics-and-gynecology/cervical-pre-invasive-diagnosis-and-treatment/

* Start eating healthy food.  

>  Previous studies have reported that women with lower intakes of vegetables and fruits as well as vitamins A, C, and E have a higher risk of high grade CIN and CC [9,12]. Accordingly, our study highlighted the protective role of the prudent dietary pattern, a Mediterranean-like diet pattern, which was negatively associated with the risk of CIN2+. Particularly, CIN2+ risk was lower among women with medium–high adherence, compared to those with low adherence to the prudent pattern. [source](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/4/469/htm)

> People who eat fruits and vegetables, which happen to be good sources of antioxidants and other phytochemicals, have a lower risk of heart disease and some neurological diseases, and there is evidence that some types of vegetables and fruits in general, protect against a number of cancers as epidemiological studies revealed, without providing the answer whether any specific bioactive molecules within fruit and vegetable have a special contribution on lower incidence. However, 80% of American children and adolescents and 68% of adults do not eat five portions a day. Inadequate dietary intakes of vitamins and minerals are widespread, most likely due to excessive consumption of energy-rich, micronutrient-poor, and refined food. [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3236599/)

* Don't smoke, don't drink too much, don't do drugs.

> Multiple studies have found both smoking and alcohol use to be significant risk factors of persistent oral and genital HPV infection. It has been proposed that the carcinogens in cigarette smoke increase viral load as well as the likelihood of cancerous transformation of the epithelial cells infected with HPV. [source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319480835_Targeting_Persistent_Human_Papillomavirus_Infection)

* You don't need to take any supplements to clear infection, however many people like to 
""do something"", just to feel better. If you have low risk HPV infection you can think about i.e. combined therapy with Inosine Pranobex or oral Zinc. If you have high risk HPV infection you can think about i.e. Inosine Pranobex or medicinal mushrooms. https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/d6qkh6/medicinal_mushrooms_immunostimulants_dietary/

* but remember: healthy lifestyle is enough to clear HPV infection.

* Daily exercise is a good idea. Check Team Body Project channel on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFjc9H89-RpWuIStDqhO7AQ). Personally I don't like exercises, but I started 2 months ago with this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC_L9qAHVJ8

* If you think too much about HPV then focus on something else, do something. Read books? Travel? Watch Netflix? HBO? Cook? Exercise? Play on PlayStation 4? Xbox One? 

* Read what different doctors say about HPV infections: 

> “HPV is extraordinarily common and is the most common sexually transmitted disease. Almost every sexually active person gets exposed to at least one, if not several, of the 15 carcinogenic viruses,” said Mark Schiffman, MD, head of the HPV unit at the Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics at the National Cancer Institute (NCI).

> “If you’ve got HIV, you’ve got HIV, but if you’ve got HPV, you’re about to not have HPV,” Schiffman said. “Nine out of 10 times you don’t have it in two years. Maybe your body suppresses it like chickenpox, maybe it is completely gone, but the result is that you are OK.”

> “If you look at the curve, what it shows is that if you wait six months, you’ve gotten rid of half your worry,” Schiffman said.

/r/HPV/comments/9k1yr0/hpv_disclosure_open_discussion/

* Many people cleared HPV infections. Read their stories: /r/HPV/comments/9pu4du/your_experiences_with_low_risk_high_risk_hpv/

* After HPV clearance it's possible to get reinfected with the same strain so if you can then get the vaccine (Gardasil or Gardasil 9)

"my story, and advice needed hi all, glad to have found this group.
I am sorry in advance how long this may be but it's the only way i can explain and keep it in order.
I just want to reach out for support and to see if anyone had anything similar happen.
If you are still here, thanks...here goes my story...


Hmmm, I am ok, have alot to say to be honest...
You don't have to read it all if you don't want to...it's gonna be long and I don't wanna drag you down...

From the time i was 18 i always got a Pap test yearly, and it was normal, i am 40 now.

Back in August of 2019 I thought I had a skin tag in my area. I went to see a nurse practitioner and she says it's genital warts. I was dumbfounded as I was with my husband for 12 years and we are monogamous. She says they could of been dormant for years in one of us and just came out. 

However she didn't say that there are venereal and ones that are std...I found this out on my own, thanks lady for making me feel gross.
To be honest mine were not std!
I went and got them cotorized that November and only have a scar now.

I got a new iud in October of this past year and got a pap, found out it had abnormal cells.

I had to get a coloscopy done in January...that is a procedure to closely examine your cervix, vagina and vulva for signs of disease. During colposcopy, your doctor uses a special instrument called a coloscope.

 February I had to get a leep procedure done.
LEEP is an abbreviation for loop electrosurgical excision procedure. It is a way to test and treat abnormal cell growth on the surface tissue of the cervix. LEEP may be recommended after abnormal changes in the cervix are confirmed by Pap tests and colposcopy biopsies. 
 LEEP allows your physician to remove the abnormal tissue and test it for cancer. 
I was nervous as heck but got it done to be in the safe side.

During this visit I am I have HPV, but she didn't explain much about it which led my husband and I to think anything and everything. We were just left to think what we were knew, well thought about it.

Turns out it's not a bad thing because most of the population has it that had sex and can fight it but I couldn't due to my compromised immune system, as I have rheumatoid arthritis. (I had to look this up)

Fast forward to April 1st and I go to my appointment. 
I go alone because my MIL wanted to go for the drive and I didn't think I would need my husband with me, even though he went to others. I think we got distracted because we weren't alone.

I go in and the doctor calmly tells me I have invasive cervical cancer. How the heck is she so calm?

I recall her saying I'm going to need a hysterectomy and possibly radiation but will have to see a specialist in 12 days.
So that was awful news to hear by myself and out of all fn days.

I go to the appointment and find out my cells are the size of salt and pepper but they want to do another leep procedure as they could only cut so much last time.
I got that done on the 19th of April and was told I was in the priority list for the pathologist. 

I waited a month trying to be calm and didn't hear anything. Then I started texting and leaving voice-mail. 
Why ate they leaving me hang.

I called on June 4th and was asked to come in tk get paper work since the doctor is off sick. 
I took a friend this time and I'm glad I did.
For some reason the doctor was there when we were and she wanted to chat.

I find out the margins are clear but the cells are 3.7 mm, I just heard a number value and kind zoned out.
I was basically told I have to go see the specialist again as they will take care of me due to the size, if it were 3.0 it would of been taken care of here at home. To see the oncologist gynecologist it is a 5 hour drive.

I seen that doctor on the 8th of June, she spoke to me about different hysterectomies. I opted for the Laparoscopic. She said she will take my tubes with it and some lymphnodes. 

I came home and have been trying to process it all.

I spoke to her again on the 15th and am told my sergury will be in 6 weeks and I'll know 2 weeks before. 

As it turns out I had an old boss reach out to me as she is going through the same thing.
I brought up the genital warts thing and she said the same happened to her but they were on the inside and not std, the doctor told her if it were not for them they would of never knew what was going on, they presented themselves I guess to show something was up with her body.
Sounds so familiar, right?

I am in absolute denial and scared to death to be put to sleep. 

Every night I get so worked up when everyone is asleep and everything is going through my mind and I can't sleep, then when I do it's like bam my son is up and hollering to me after 9.

My surgery date is the 16th.

I actually have been posting and following the hysterectomy sub on here.
It has been helping a bit.

"Feeling afraid to get vaccinated after growing up in antivax family Due to my parents beliefs, I have only ever received vaccines as a baby. Over the past couple years I have wanted to get vaccinated, and now that I am an adult, I have the chance to do so. However, I realized that I am really scared of it because of the way I was raised. When you have never had a certain procedure done in your entire memory AND you have always been discouraged and told scary things about vaccines by your own mother (vaccines causing inflammation, disabling side effects, etc), it has quite the effect on the psyche. I am scared that I'll have an allergic reaction or some really bad side effects if I get a vaccine. It doesn't help at all that I have struggled with health anxiety before, so I'll probably be really worried the entire time, which could even mimic or exacerbate side effects. I also don't really have people to support me in this except my grandma who lives across the country, so I'll be all alone...

Has anyone ever had similar experiences and if so, how'd you deal with it? And if anyone has any recommendations for how I can become calmer and less skeptical/afraid about it, I am open to listening.

"Honest Question About Vaccine Injury and Potential Allergies / Side-effects Hey everyone.    


My wife and a number of people that I know personally are antivax.  I honestly didn't look too much into it until recently, and just kind of went along with it for a long time.  Eventually, I decided to do some research for myself, and I'm now in favor of vaccinating our children.  My wife still doesn't want to, but we're going to anyway.  She got a lot of her info from mom's groups and other people on Facebook, and even some close friends of ours who had a vaccine injury in their family.  I believe the injured person has some form of autism, and they get a check from the government to cover it.    


So anyway, whenever I try to give the reasons that we should vaccinate, and not be worried.  My main point is that logically if vaccines were causing major issues in a large enough percentage of cases, we would know, because so many people are vaccinated that it would be nearly impossible to cover up!  But one of the things she and others bring up often is ""if vaccines aren't dangerous, why does the government have a vaccine injury compensation program?  This proves that vaccines can cause problems.""  Naturally, my answer is that unfortunately yes issues can take place, seemingly for people with allergies or other preexisting conditions, but it's not a significant risk.  

&#x200B;

But the part about all of this that bothers / stumps me is the fact that if we promote vaccination for EVERYONE, we do so knowing that it could seriously harm a (very small) percentage of them.  If we know that this could cause problems for certain individuals, can't we simply run tests FIRST before administering the vaccines, to rule out any allergies or other potential complications?  As far as I know, that isn't happening (at least not here in California) but I'm open to being corrected on this.  To me it seems like it would help the pro-vaccine efforts to simply be up front and educate about the potential risks, being sure to provide statistics to set people at ease.  As a parent, I can see why it may be scary for someone to basically be told ""vaccines can't cause any problems ever"" and then find out about the VICP--it looks shady!  It would be much more reassuring to be given that info up front, and explain that the risk is so small as to be insignificant.  I find the whole anti-vax situation unfortunate, because a part of me really does understand where some of these fears come from, and I think that education is the key to avoiding the panic.   


Anyway, I hope this makes sense.  I'm simply looking for information, and if any of the info I've presented is incorrect, please let me know.  "	1
"Getting the Covid vaccine 

I’m currently working as a hospitalist in a place where we’ve started rolling out the vaccine (Pfizer) to us healthcare professionals. There’s a great deal of apprehension about this among us about taking it. We’re definitely not anti vaxxers, but I guess being from a demographic (30-40 with no comorbids) where Covid isn’t particularly lethal is making us think twice on whether it is worth taking the risk and opting in for a vaccine that has no long term safety data.

What are your thoughts on the matter? I see quite a few here have already gotten the vaccine. Can you explain your frame of mind and help me have a different perspective?"	0

Since i chose not to get vaccinated i got out of school due to overwhelming bullying from my class comrades, also i got kicked out of my football team cause i didn’t get the shot. I am now doing home school, i have no goals anymore and i am getting really bored.i have the feeling of getting rejected by society i get weird looks everywhere i go because i do not where a mask ( in canada the mask is obligated everywhere except outside. The vaccine passport too except essentials). I recently thought about the fact that my life will never be the same. I lost a big part of my friends and got cyber bullied by one of them. So what i want to say is people that don’t have my opinion dont hate on me just respect my opinions and i will respect yours.

"32F, high risk HPV. From CIN2,CIN1 to normal(fingers crossed)in 6 months 
Hey guys!
I wanted to drop by and share an update on my situation because I think it might be helpful for others going through something similar. If you’re curious about my earlier posts, you can check my profile for the backstory about abnormal cervical cells and HPV.

So, a quick recap: I’m 32, and back in June, I was diagnosed with high-risk HPV and CIN2. The changes in my cervix were moderate to mild, and I was given the option of conservative treatment and were open for me going straight for a LEEP procedure. After reading tons of advice (thank you to this sub!) and speaking to a few people, I was leaning towards getting the LEEP done. My thinking was that it’s better to remove abnormal cells before they progress and I’m anyway not too keen to have children. 

. On the day of the procedure, my doctor , my doctor told me it was more than just about having children that since I’m young—even though I’m not planning on having kids— she said that while LEEP is definitely the right call if it’s CIN3, it’s worth holding off for CIN2 if I’m okay with waiting and monitoring instead. HPV is notorious and a life long risk so if it comes back again it will travel down to vagina and those tissues will keep needing removal so I should avoid as much as possible for futures sake. She recommended sticking with conservative treatment for six months and reassessing.

I’ll admit I was skeptical, but I decided to trust her and wait it out max for 6 months. Fast forward to today: I just had my follow-up colposcopy, and to my absolute surprise, my cervix looks completely healthy. Like, no CIN1 or CIN2 in sight. Even I could see it on the monitor, last time there were visible changes. The doctor told me this is common and she sees this in most patients below 40 and said there was no need for a biopsy this time, but she did take a smear to check if some abnormal changes show up or I’m still HPV-positive or not. I’ll keep you guys updated when those results come back, but for now, things look great!

Looking back, I’m so glad I didn’t go ahead with the LEEP. if it had progressed to CIN3, I would’ve done it in a heartbeat, but for CIN2, I’d recommend getting a second opinion you’re under 40 and have a good doctor who’s willing to monitor closely.

I know everyone’s situation is different, and there’s no one-size-fits-all answer. I just wanted to share my story in case it helps someone else who’s stuck between “wait and see” and “just get it.

For context, I’m based in the UK, and this was all through the NHS. Super grateful for the care I received and the outcome so far. Fingers crossed my smear results back this up!"	1
"Colp or Not... Bless you if you choose to read this and bless you again if you had a similar situation... I feel alone but hope I am not. Note: I am going through IVF treatments - not due to infertility. Same sex relationship with limited donor sperm.

In March of 2023 I had my first abnormal pap - came back HPV Positive 18/45. Squamous cell abnormality. Low-grade squamous (LSIL). Colposcopy performed. Two areas biopsied, both came back negative. Told to come back in a year.

May 2024 in the middle of IVF journey, and ready to start meds for first transfer. Abnormal Pap - HPV positive 18/45. Squamous cell abnormality. Atypical squamous (ASC-US). 

My OBGYN wants to do another colposcopy which would impact timing for IVF transfer and meds. **Has anyone received the same results? Specifically**: **HPV Positive - ASC-US and had a colposcopy come back positive?** Even better if you had these results AFTER a negative colposcopy. 

I'm weighing my options... trying to get real life answers and multiple doctor opinions. Any feedback would be so appreciated."	0

"As an almost 40 year old adult in Canada, what vaccines should I make sure I'm up to date with? I recently read an article about an increase in meningitis, this lead me to obtaining my childhood vaccine list. I see that I never received any meningitis vaccines. I contacted my doctor and have an appointment to go discuss getting the vaccines. She for some reason didn't suggest I get them (seems like a horrible way to die getting meningitis). 

I will have to pay for these as it's not covered here in Ontario for over 38 (I just missed it).

"RE: earnings call 11/14/24: We incurred a large expense to demonstrate (81%) the cellular immunity documenting 3107 mechanism of action (for 32 patients). EU/FDA will need 100 participants, using random sampling. Same for 3112. More expensive, but  DNA is new science. 

Progress on all fronts:

(A lot of discussion of the data obtained and its significance was required after the 3100 study since it was rejected by FDA previously but of high importance is timing of 3107 rollout). 

""The BLA study should be ready by **mid-2025**; FDA requires their **confirmatory study to begin before the BLA is submitted and then run concurrently.** 

The FDA promises 6-month turnaround so Inovio should be ready for a commercial 3107 launch by year-end 2025. There is no need for a redosing study, as previously they have seen 3107 effectiveness last up to 500-800 days,"" (1.5 -2.5 years).

About ***3112 with Loqtorzi***: Mike Sumner -- *Chief Medical Officer and RRP Program Lead*

""...we've got an **alignment from the FDA on the design that we proposed for that study. We're in discussions with the EMA, and we're expecting feedback to gain alignment**. HPV is a global disease, and in most high-income countries, the incidence of throat cancer continues to rise. So, we would very much like to run this study across -- in both regions.""

However CEO Shea points out: **""...for 3112, starting that phase 3 trial is dependent on resolving this device issue as well,"" (expected by year end 2024)**. There may be an advantage to redosing if the device proves to create more effective results after the repair of the dosing element.

Shea on other pipeline products: 

""For ***INO-3112***, we've consulted with European regulators regarding the design of our proposed phase 3 trial, evaluating **3112 in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor Loqtorzi as a potential treatment for locally advanced HPV16 and 18 positive high-risk oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, also known as throat cancer.**

We anticipate conducting this trial in North America and Europe. Previous discussions with t***he FDA have indicated alignment with the proposed trial design.***

Continuing ***in oncology for INO-5401, patients continue to be dosed in the GBM-001 trial in newly diagnosed glioblastoma that combines 5401 with Regeneron's PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, Libtayo. Regeneron and Inovio have discussed that*** **an appropriate next step for GBM could be a controlled phase 2 trial.**

 ***A separate trial evaluating 5401 in patients with the BRCA mutation is ongoing at the Basser Center at the University of Pennsylvania.""***

 (A BRCA mutation means you have a likelihood of 45% to 85% for developing breast cancer in your lifetime, along with a 10% to 46% chance of ovarian cancer. The **probability of breast cancer among the general population is about 12%. Ovarian cancer is rarer, affecting less than 1% of the population**…If you have a mutation, your biological parents, siblings, and children each have a 50% chance of having the same mutation. Your distant family members may also be at risk for having the same mutation.)

***""We also have an upcoming meeting scheduled with the FDA later this quarter*** to discuss t**he phase 2 trial design and development pathway for INO-4201 as a heterologous boost to the FDA-licensed Ebola vaccine, Ervebo.""**

 ""From our earlier stage candidates, ***we expect clinical data from an ongoing phase 1 study with DNA-encoded monoclonal antibodies to be submitted to a peer-reviewed publication by year-end.*** 

***We believe this will be the first clinical data for DNA-delivered monoclonal antibodies to be reported and illustrates what we believe to be the transformational potential of our DNA medicines platform.***

"3rd dose after Sinovac vaccine COVID-19 Hi there! Here in Chile we got vaccinated mostly with Sinovac for COVID. I’m 20 and my 2nd dose with Sinovac was on July 19. Now the government is giving us a 3rd dose with Pfizer next week, but I’m a little skeptical about it cause I’ve heard from a Doctor here that you should vaccinate with another formula (3rd dose) within 6 months. 
Is there any research on this? Would it be safe to get the 3rd dose? 
Ps: sorry for my English if any mistakes were made."	1
Fever of 103 with every vaccine I’m an adult female who only periodically gets vaccinated. But when I do, it doesn’t matter which one it is (flu, covid, DTP, etc), I run up to 103F fever, sometimes just short of 103 within 8-10 hours. No other symptoms but chills, aches that come with fever for about 48 hours. I get a bad rash with Tylenol so that’s out. It used to be I’d just tolerate the fever, and if I couldn’t take it anymore I’d dip in to Tylenol and it would quickly come down. I’d rather not take anything and let my immune system work. But I’m going to a flu shot tomorrow. If that fever goes up to 103 and I’m having a tough time am I going to hurt my immunity by taking Aleve? 	1
"Is Moderna 50mcg or Pfizer 30mcg booster more effective? There was a big NIH study in October on which COVID booster is most effective, comparing Moderna 100mcg, Pfizer 30mcg, and J&J. It found that regardless of which of Moderna, Pfizer, and J&J the individual got for their primary series, a Moderna 100mcg booster is most effective. However, the dose that was later approved by the US FDA and CDC, and which is being administered now, is Moderna 50mcg, not 100mcg. So the study doesn't really tell us which of the boosters we can actually get is most effective.

Considering waiting before taking the vaccine. How can I get a more informed view on this? I’ve got my first dose of Pfizer, and up until today I was planning on getting the booster shot. Now I’m unsure, mainly because of the potential myocarditis/pericarditis after the second dose and the novelty of RNA-vaccines in this many humans, although what made me more unsure was the leaked video of Pfizer employees saying in private that natural immunity from getting covid is better than the vaccine, and how employees are told to not talk about that publicly. (the people who filmed them clearly have a biased anti-vax agenda, although I don’t think that invalidates the Pfizer employees’ points). I want to take the vaccine if I find that the benefits outweigh the risks. I’m a healthy 20-year old male in a country with good access to healthcare, and I’m not in regular contact with anyone who is at risk. Specifically because of the (slightly) higher risk of heart issues from the second dose for young males, I want to consider what the best action is. It seems like most people are taking the vaccine without a second thought because everyone else is doing it, and although taking it may be the right thing to do, I want to make sure it is. I understand that this is a controversial issue, so I would really appreciate if you are not dismissive or patronising, but try to give your best advice. I’m genuinely searching for the truth, not a disagreement. Thanks!	1

"Genital warts- a success story (F) I wanted to share with you that life is not over after discovering genital warts. I feel like most of the post on here generate fear and self doubt. I would often search for solace on here, only to come up empty handed. I’m here to tell you that YOU WILL RECOVER and that there is hope. GW will not define you nor hinder your life. Here is my story:

May 2021 I noticed bumps near my perianal and anal region. Very small bumps but many. I didn’t think anything of it since I’m an avid cyclist. I associated the “bumps” with bike sores. I wasn’t sexually active and didn’t have a primary partner. I thought nothing of it until I had my annual gynecology visit. 

October 13, 2021 (2 days before my birthday) I saw my gynecologist. As he was checking my area, he looks stunned. I go, what’s wrong? He goes.. “Miss it looks like you have genital warts. Your condition is so bad that I cannot help you. I don’t have the equipment and I can’t give you prescription medication because your condition is widespread. They are all over your anal area, perianal area and your vulva. You are riddled with them. Please set up an appointment with a specialist to preform surgery.” And when I asked.. “is there anything in the mean time I can do?” He says “no”. At that moment I felt hopeless, scared and confused. Why me? It didn’t make any sense. I wasn’t sexually active and exercised regularly. 

Once he told me he couldn’t help me, I did some research to find a specialist who preformed laser surgery. My gynecologist reiterated the fact that laser surgery was my only option. So I found one that did just that. After 2 months of waiting, I was finally able to start treatment.

In the meantime, I would cry every night thinking no one would want me ever again. I would scream and beg God to heal me. I felt hopeless, stuck and ashamed. I over medicated myself and abused narcotics to numb my internal, never ending anguish. I thought “this is it, this will be my life forever.”

Fast forward to December 13, 2021. I saw a surgeon. She took one look at me and goes. “Wow I haven’t seen a condition this bad since the 80’s but do not worry, I will take care of you.” Finally some hope I thought! Someone will finally help me. I told her my previous doctor told me I had to get surgery. She goes.. let’s do cryotherapy first. I agreed. I was desperate and willing to do anything to get rid of these warts. She spent a total of 20 minutes working on me. I was in pain but was determined to sit through it. Some were too big so she had to cut them off. After she finished she prescribed me imiquimod. She told me to apply the imiquimod to my vulva area 2 times a week for 6 weeks.

After applying the imiquimod, I noticed a huge improvement after 2 weeks. After 6 weeks, I couldn’t see them anymore. During this six week period, I exercised regularly and took vitamin D3 and Zinc Sulfate.

January 24, 2021, I go for my follow up. She looks at my in awe and goes. “you’re hpv free, all your perianal, anal and vulva warts are gone. You don’t need to worry anymore. Forget this ever happened. Just be more careful in the future.”

And just like that.. I was able to move on. Forget these ever existed and move on with my life. She also told me not to feel shame or guilt, and live a happy and fulling sex life. 

Tonight, March 1st 2022, I am still clear. I take zinc sulfate and vitamin D3 regularly and exercise regularly.  I often think to myself.. all that worrying was a waste of energy. If I could go back in time and say “look everything will be ok and this is not as serious as it seems to be” I would. 

To whoever is reading this, you will heal. You will recover and hope is not lost. Be patient, be persistent with treatment. Let go of the present and look forward to the future. You will prevail, I promise you. 

Please feel free to comment or PM me if you  have any questions. I wish you all the best of luck and a quick recovery! <3

UPDATE:

I’m still wart free after 2 years. I never had a reoccurrence after my initial encounter. 

I feel so honored and greatful that this post has impacted so many people and changed the course of their view with contracting HPV. 

I come back to this thread occasionally to see if any others had success with their HPV clearance. It saddens me that most people don’t circulate back to state their current status. 

If theres any additional advice I could give you, it’s this: after clearance, avoid this thread at all costs. 
It will only feed into your fears and doubts of reoccurrence. I promised myself that after two years, I would update this post. 

Best of luck to anyone that is still struggling with HPV. I know the feeling, I’ve been there and you are certainly not alone. Please don’t be embarrassed or ashamed. Free your mind and let it go. <3"	0

"Welcome to /r/HPV - A safe place to go when times are hard Quote from /r/STD - it applies to /r/HPV either:

> The sub is intended to help calm the anxiety that comes with a potential STD infection through education, awareness, and prevention techniques. If you have concerns about your health, please seek a health care provider to address the concerns you have. No subreddit's contents can replace actual medical care from a physician.

**1. INTRODUCTION**

As CDC says:

> HPV infections are so common that nearly all men and women will get at least one type of HPV at some point in their lives. Most people never know that they have been infected and may give HPV to a sex partner without knowing it. Nearly 80 million Americans are currently infected with some type of HPV. About 14 million people in the United States become newly infected each year.

> Most people with HPV never develop symptoms or health problems. Most HPV infections (9 out of 10) go away by themselves within two years. But, sometimes, HPV infections will last longer, and can cause certain cancers and other diseases. HPV infections can cause:

> * cancers of the cervix, vagina, and vulva in women;

> * cancers of the penis in men; and

> * cancers of the anus and back of the throat, including the base of the tongue and tonsils (oropharynx), in both women and men.

> * warts and genital warts

> Most HPV infections are transient and asymptomatic, causing no symptoms. More than 90% of new HPV infections, including those caused by high-risk HPV types, clear or become undetectable within 2 years, and clearance usually occurs in the first 6 months after infection.

As dr Handsfield wrote:

> Probably 25-30% of all sexually active men in North America or Europe are diagnosed at one time or another with genital warts. (...) Going further, at least 90% get HPV at least once, and at any point in time at least 50% of all men and women in their 20s and 30s have active HPV infections.

**IMPORTANT message for MSM:** please vaccinate yourself as soon as possible:

> Participant mean age was 25 years (range = 18–40), with 48.9% self-identifying as gay and 86.5% reporting having sex exclusively with men. At baseline, 530 participants had HPV DNA present (61.1% with high-risk HPV, 84.9% with low-risk HPV)

**2. HOW TO KEEP MENTAL HEALTH DURING HPV INFECTION?**

* Remember that you are not alone.

> HPV infections are so common that nearly all men and women will get at least one type of HPV at some point in their lives. Most people never know that they have been infected and may give HPV to a sex partner without knowing it. Nearly 80 million Americans are currently infected with some type of HPV.

* You are not dirty or worse than other people. Other people just don't know bout their active or previous infections.

* Calm down. Don't stress yourself. Be patient.

> ""Women who reported self-destructive coping strategies, like drinking, smoking cigarettes or taking drugs when stressed, were more likely to develop an active HPV infection,"" said principal investigator Anna-Barbara Moscicki, MD, FAAP, chief of the Division of Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine and professor of pediatrics at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Medicine. ""We also found that women who were depressed or perceived themselves to have lots of stress were more likely to have HPV persistence,"" she said, adding that this study is the first to show these connections between stress and HPV persistence. [source](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160430100243.htm)

* See this video about HPV infections: https://youtu.be/KOz-bNhEHhQ

* Stop reading random pages and sources about HPV. There is lots of misinformation and scary stories. 

* Stick to reliable websites, for example: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt05-hpv.html) or [McGill](https://www.mcgill.ca/traphpv/hpvfacts).

* I will repeat once again: read CDC's and McGill's websites.

* Remember that 64% infections clear within 6 months, 80% within 12 months. 

> When researchers looked at the 10 most prevalent types of HPV, they noted 36% of prevalent infections persisted after six months, 20% persisted to 12 months, 13% persisted to 18 months and 9% persisted to 24 months (95% CI for all). [source](

* Remember that HPV is not for life.

> Most HPV infections in young men and women are transient, lasting no more than one or two years. Usually, the body clears the infection on its own. It is estimated that the infection will persist in only about 1% of women. It is those infections that persist which may lead to cancer. There is some research that suggests that the virus can hide deep in the affected mucosa or skin for several years, below detectable levels. These are called “latent” infections. Having an HPV-positive test followed by an HPV-negative test might mean two different things: that the virus has been completely cleared by the body, or that the level of infection is so small that laboratory tests cannot detect it. Thus, HPV might “reappear” several years after an infection (whether or not it was treated) when the immune system weakens (because of aging, pregnancy, illness, etc.) and then cause lesions. It is unknown what proportion of HPV infections go latent, nor what proportions are truly cleared by the body.

https://mcgill.ca/traphpv/hpvfacts

* If you have CIN then calm down too:

>HPV infection is necessary but not sufficient to develop CIN. More than 90% of infections are spontaneously cleared by the immune system within one year without treatment. Approximately 60% of CIN 1 lesions regress without treatment and less than 1% progress to cancer. However, it is estimated that 5% of CIN 2 and 12% of CIN 3 cases will progress to invasive cancer if untreated. In general, it takes 10 to 20 years for CIN to progress to cancer, allowing a significant time period for detection and treatment. Progression from CIN to cancer requires persistent HPV infection.

> Co-factors associated with persistent HPV infection and progression of disease include smoking, HIV infection, and other types of immunosuppression.

[source](https://www.cancertherapyadvisor.com/home/decision-support-in-medicine/obstetrics-and-gynecology/cervical-pre-invasive-diagnosis-and-treatment/)

* Start eating healthy food.  

>  Previous studies have reported that women with lower intakes of vegetables and fruits as well as vitamins A, C, and E have a higher risk of high grade CIN and CC [9,12]. Accordingly, our study highlighted the protective role of the prudent dietary pattern, a Mediterranean-like diet pattern, which was negatively associated with the risk of CIN2+. Particularly, CIN2+ risk was lower among women with medium–high adherence, compared to those with low adherence to the prudent pattern. [source](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/4/469/htm)

> People who eat fruits and vegetables, which happen to be good sources of antioxidants and other phytochemicals, have a lower risk of heart disease and some neurological diseases, and there is evidence that some types of vegetables and fruits in general, protect against a number of cancers as epidemiological studies revealed, without providing the answer whether any specific bioactive molecules within fruit and vegetable have a special contribution on lower incidence. However, 80% of American children and adolescents and 68% of adults do not eat five portions a day. Inadequate dietary intakes of vitamins and minerals are widespread, most likely due to excessive consumption of energy-rich, micronutrient-poor, and refined food.

* You can check [Sten Ekberg's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/drekberg) about keto and low-carb diet.

* Don't smoke, don't drink too much, don't do drugs.

> Multiple studies have found both smoking and alcohol use to be significant risk factors of persistent oral and genital HPV infection. It has been proposed that the carcinogens in cigarette smoke increase viral load as well as the likelihood of cancerous transformation of the epithelial cells infected with HPV. [source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319480835_Targeting_Persistent_Human_Papillomavirus_Infection)

* You don't need to take any supplements to clear infection, however many people like to ""do something"", just to feel better. If you have low risk HPV infection you can think about i.e. combined therapy with Inosine Pranobex or oral Zinc. If you have high risk HPV infection you can think about i.e. Inosine Pranobex or medicinal mushrooms.

* but remember: usually the healthy lifestyle is enough to clear HPV infection.

* Daily exercise is a good idea. Check Team Body Project channel on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFjc9H89-RpWuIStDqhO7AQ). Personally I don't like exercises, but I started 2 months ago with this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC_L9qAHVJ8

* If you think too much about HPV then focus on something else, do something. Read books? Travel? Watch Netflix? HBO? Cook? Exercise? Play on PlayStation 4? Xbox One? [Listen to The Good Life Radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIWVfkF2IeI)?

* Read what different doctors say about HPV infections: 

> “HPV is extraordinarily common and is the most common sexually transmitted disease. Almost every sexually active person gets exposed to at least one, if not several, of the 15 carcinogenic viruses,” said Mark Schiffman, MD, head of the HPV unit at the Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics at the National Cancer Institute (NCI).

> “If you’ve got HIV, you’ve got HIV, but if you’ve got HPV, you’re about to not have HPV,” Schiffman said. “Nine out of 10 times you don’t have it in two years. Maybe your body suppresses it like chickenpox, maybe it is completely gone, but the result is that you are OK.”

> “If you look at the curve, what it shows is that if you wait six months, you’ve gotten rid of half your worry,” Schiffman said.

* Many people cleared HPV infections. Read their stories: https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/9pu4du/your_experiences_with_low_risk_high_risk_hpv/

* After HPV clearance it's possible to get reinfected with the same strain so if you can then get the vaccine (Gardasil or Gardasil 9)

**3. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (F.A.Q)**

**Q: I have a que...**

Before asking any questions download and read the CDC's guideline:

* https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/31403

**Q: Can I upload my photos to /r/HPV?**

No, you can't. There are special subreddits such as /r/IsThisHPV /r/genitalwarts /r/Warts where you can upload your photos. Besides of that only a real doctor can diagnose you. Some people think that Fordyce spots, Vestibular papillomatosis, Pearly penile papules or Molluscum are warts.

**Q: I'm a virgin. Can I have genital warts?**

Very unlikely. You can search Google for keywords:

* Fordyce spots

* Seborrheic keratosis

* Pearly penile papules

**Q: How to deal with stress?**

Check this NHS website:

* [Things you can try to help with stress](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/understanding-stress/)

**Q: Does HPV infection mean infidelity?**

> HPV is often shared between partners and can lie dormant for many years; having HPV does not imply infidelity, nor should it necessarily raise concerns about a partner’s health.

https://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/hpv-cancer.htm

**Q: Does removing genital warts remove the infection?**

No (that's why recurrence rates are high).

**Q: Will I have genital warts forever?**

Only ~1% people with low risk HPV have recurrent genital warts. 

**Q: What are genital warts transmission rates?**

> Genital warts are very contagious, with an estimated rate of infection between 60 and 75 percent from unprotected exposure (NIAID, 2004; Soper, 2002). The incubation period for genital warts is usually between three weeks and six months, but it may last for years after exposure (ASHA, 1998; ASHA, 2006).

[source](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/8913/9611/8041/HPV.pdf)

**Q: Will I have oral warts?**

Around 0.5% people have oral warts and 5% people with HIV, so there is no need to panic about oral warts. If you want to get a proper diagnosis then see ENT (Ear Neck Throat) doctor.

> Oral warts are usually asymptomatic, may be persistent or uncommonly, may regress spontaneously. HPV-associated oral warts have a prevalence of 0.5% in the general population, occur in up to 5% of HIV-seropositive subjects, and in up to 23% of HIV-seropositive subjects on highly active antiretroviral therapy.

**How about HPV and relationships?**

Here is dr Handsfield's opinion: answer to the question #4882

> Over time, almost all HPV infections are suppressed or entirely eradicated by the immune system.

> Our usual advice about genital warts is that people should either abstain with new partners, or advise potential partners of their infection, for 3-6 months after treatment, then not necessary if no recurrence of the wart. These are not science-based guidelines, just a common sense approach of many STD experts.

> But none of this applies to current, ongoing partner(s). You can safely assume regular partners have already been repeatedly exposed, and no need or benefit to stopping contact now. That horse is long out of the barn, no use in closing the door now.

https://www.askexpertsnow.com/ask-the-experts/

**Q: Is HPV for life?**

Comment from /r/Virology /u/CJay07

> I studied HPV for my PhD work, and the statement that ""HPV is with you for life"" isn't accurate. Most sexually active individuals are infected with HPV at one point during their lifetime. Epidemiological estimates range from 60-80% by the time you reach your forties. However, most infections are cleared by the immune system within a few months. A small subset of those individuals that do not clear the virus maintain a persistent infection (~1-2 years), but even those infections get cleared. An even smaller set of people go on to cancer. By that time however, the virus is generally long gone. One common situation in HPV-associated cancer is where the viral genome accidentally becomes a part of the host chromosome and the oncogenic (tumor promoting) elements of the virus become constitutively expressed. Those elements lead to rapid cell growth, among other things. Despite a little bit of the viral genome present at this stage, no viral particles can (or will be) produced.

> HPV infects basal epithelial stem cells, which are self renewing and give rise to the rest of the skin architecture. Here, the virus is maintained as an episome (viral DNA tethered to the host chromosome). There are no in tact virus particles here. Just viral DNA. It takes about three weeks for daughter cells (cells produced from the epithelial stem cells) to reach the surface, and it is not until during the final stages of cellular differentiation (cells becoming keratinized, stratifying, forming the uppermost layers of the skin) that you actually get the production of infectious virus particles. The virus coat (capsid), which envelops and protects the viral DNA, is produced very late during skin differentiation. This is a very fancy mechanism for immune evasion if you think about it. The superficial layers of the skin are not routinely surveyed by the immune system (because these cells are going to die), so by the time HPV expresses its most immunogenic products (the capsid proteins), immune cells are rarely to be found. This is one thought for how HPV can persist for so long (months to years), although the virus has many other ""tricks"" up its sleeve to hide from the immune system. With all that being said, when I say ""virus is cleared"", I mean the viral DNA is gone from its reservoir cell (the epithelial stem cell). Once that is gone, you don't have new viral particles being produced, and those particles that are hanging out on/in the skin will be lost during the natural turnover of the skin. This process wouldn't take long. It's more on the order of weeks, rather than years.

**Q: How many people have latent infections?**

Information submitted by /u/IvoryHorse:

**Q: Why HPV clearance takes so much time?**

> The host’s immune response to HPV infection (humoral immunity, mainly IgG) is usually slow, weak, wane over time, and varied considerably with many women not seroconverting. Generally, close to half of the individuals seroconvert to L1 protein of HPV 16, 18, or 6 within 18 months. Other HPV antigens [E1, E2, E6, and L2] do not evoke any antibody responses in patients with acute or persistent HPV infection. Natural infection-elicited antibodies may not provide complete protection to HPV over time. A recent WHO position paper stated that host antibodies, mostly directed against the viral L1 protein, do not necessarily protect against subsequent infection by the same HPV genotype.

**Read these links before asking questions about oral HPV.**

**Q: What are the first-line treatments against genital warts?**

You can try Cryotherapy, Imiquimod / Aldara, Podophyllotoxin, Veregen, Laser surgery. Don't use Podophyllin. The problem with all treatments is that there are high recurrence rates. Removing GWs doesn't mean HPV clearance. It's just removing symptoms.

**Q: How about urethral warts?**

You can ask your doctor about Laser surgery, electrocauterization (painful), [ingenol mebutate](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956462418824453) (expensive) or [photodynamic therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2133.2004.06189.x).

**Q: I'm gay. What doctor should I see?**

* Urologist/dermatologist for external genital warts.

* Proctologist for internal genital warts.

* Remember about vaccination and regular anal pap smears.

**Q: What are the first-line treatments against nongenital warts?**

Salicylic acid and Cryotherapy. Check this article:

**Q: Can immunotherapy be used against warts?**

Yes, please check this link and download the PDF file:

* https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3md9z8gj

**Q: How to use Podophyllotoxin? How to use Imiquimod? How to use...?**

* Always read leaflets

* Always check possible side-effects

* Some supplements (i.e. Zinc) can cause side-effects, so consult usage of them with your doctor

* Follow your doctor's instructions (unless they are not correct i.e. contradicts informations from the leaflets)

**Q: How effective are treatments against genital warts?**

See this PDF:

* https://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/evidence-tables/HPVTableEvidence-GenitalWarts-2015.pdf

Another study:

> The most efficacious treatments compared to placebo were surgery (RR 10.54; CI 95% 4.53–24.52), ablative therapy + imiquimod (RR 7.52; CI 95% 4.53–24.52), and electrosurgery (RR 7.10; CI 95% 3.47–14.53). SUCRA values confirmed the superiority of surgery (90.9%), ablative therapy + imiquimod (79.8%), and electrosurgery (77.1%). The most efficacious patient-administered treatments were podophyllotoxin 0.5% solution (63.5%) and podophyllotoxin 0.5% cream (62.2%).

**Q: My doctor suggested podophyllin against genital warts. Should I use it?**

Read this PDF:

* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1744412/pdf/v077p00409.pdf

**Q: Which treatments should I use?**

Ask your doctor/s. They finished medical schools and get money from you. Let them do their job. If your doctor is ignorant then find a better one.

**Q: Can I use OTC freeze kits against GWs?**

No. Avoid ignorant and dangerous ideas from some random people/websites. Dr School's clearly states:

>Do not use on areas with thin skin such as the face, armpits, breasts, bottom, or genitals. Use on these areas may cause burns and permanent scarring.

> Do not use on moles, birthmarks, warts with hair growing from them, genital (on penis or vaginal areas) warts, or on warts on the face or mucous membranes (such as inside mouth, nose, anus, genitals, lips, ears or near eyes). It may cause burns and permanent scarring of skin or blindness.

**Q: My doctor gave me Podophyllotoxin... My doctor gave me Imiquimod / Aldara… can I use it more often? I'm really desperated.**

No. Don't do it. You will get serious side-effects. Stick to the instructions from your doctor and from the leaflets. One time I used Podophyllotoxin for 3.5 days (it should be used for 3 days) and it created small wounds in my genital area. It wasn't a nice experience.

**Q: Can I combine Cryotherapy and Podophyllotoxin?**

See [this clinical study](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/abba/2343b4c6058caa29843c45d3e0c5e63dc8c7.pdf) and ask your doctor.

**Q: What is the cheapest/easiest way to lower chances for GW recurrences?**

Propably it's genital warts removal combined with oral Zinc or Zinc Sulphate. Unfortunately Zinc can cause side-effects in some people. Always read the original clinical studies to know all details (i.e. about dosage).

* https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/201912.0029/v1

**Q: Are there any new therapies against genital warts?**

There is ISDIN Verrutop, which can be used against nongenital and genital warts. It's made in Spain but can be ordered from online shop in Portugal. ISDIN Verrutop should be applied by health professionals. Check its leaflet: [LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/eg5aex/isdin_verrutop_nitrizinc_complex_the_text_from/).

**Q: Is it safe to get pregnant soon after LEEP procedure?**

It will be better if you will wait at least 12 months.

> Five hundred ninety-six patients met inclusion criteria. Median time from LEEP to pregnancy was significantly shorter for women with an spontaneous abortion (20 months, interquartile range 11.2–40.9 vs. 31 months, interquartile range 18.7–51.2, p-value 0.01), but did not differ for women with a term birth compared to preterm birth. Women with a time interval shorter than 12 months compared to 12 months or more had a significantly increased risk for spontaneous abortion (17.9% vs. 4.6%, aOR 5.6, 95%CI 2.5–12.7).

**Q: Are there any effective laser therapies (besides laser surgery)?**

There is photodynamic therapy (effective against genital warts and CIN)

> By 1 week after the last treatment, the complete clearance rate was 95.93% in the ALA?PDT group and 100% in CO2 laser group (P>0.05). The clearance rate of CA at male urethral orifice was100% in the ALA?PDT group and 100% in the CO2 laser group (P>0.05). The overall recurrence rate calculated by the end of the entire follow?up period was significantly lower in the ALA?PDT group than that in the CO2 laser group (9.38% vs 17.39%, P<0.05).

[source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14764170600617490)

Unfortunately both therapies are not available for the most people. 

**Q: What are the recurrence rates for genital warts?**

You can find the answer for this question (and other basic questions) in [CDC manual](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt05-hpv.html).

> Recurrence of anogenital warts within 3 months is common (approximately 30%), whether clearance occurs spontaneously or following treatment.

**Q: I have strong genital warts outbreaks. Why?**

There are many possibilities, for example:

* HIV

* immunodeficiency

* uncontrolled diabetes

**Q: I have Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis. Is there any hope for me?**

Please check clinical studies about RRP and Gardasil. You can also check the studies about MVA E2 therapeutic vaccine.

**Q: I don't have a health insurance. Can I use Apple Cider Vinegar? ACV?**

ACV can cause chemical burns, scars or make your skin thicker. It's always better to see a doctor than try not reliable ""home remedies"". If you live in the USA then Planned Parenthood clinics should be affordable.

One Redditor wrote:

**Q: Where can I find the informations about different HPV strains? Is there any list of different strains?**

Check this PDF file:

* https://monographs.iarc.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mono90.pdf

**Q: Are there any therapeutic vaccines?**

There aren't any comercially available therapeutic vaccines, however there are some vaccines that showed efficiency in clinical studies:

* MVA E2, intralesional, very effective, tested in Mexico. It's intralesional, so can be used against GWs, CIN and RRP.

* VGX-3100, less effective, but there is a big corporation (Inovio) behind it. It can be used against high risk HPV.

* INO-3107, another vaccine created by Inovio. Actually it's being tested against Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (HPV 6 and HPV 11).

* BLS-M07, oral vaccine actually being tested in South Korea. It can be used against high risk HPV.

There are many ongoing clinical trials:

* https://www.dovepress.com/therapeutic-vaccines-for-hpv-associated-malignancies-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-ITT

Besides of that some scientists / dermatologists use:

* Intralesional MMR vaccine (off-label usage) against genital and nongenital warts.

* Intralesional Candida antigen (off-label usage) against nongenital warts.

* Intralesional BCG vaccine (off-label usage) against nongenital warts.

"Does the HPV vaccine have bad side effects in a person who has autism? Hello I would like to know if anyone has any information about this. I'm a 20 year old woman with asperger syndrome and have thinking about getting the HPV vaccine so I don't end up like my mother who had cervical cancer due to HPV. 

My father said that the vaccine causes bad side effects in people who have autism. He got the information from an article on a group he's apart of, and stated that the article information is legit. A legitimate study done in europe on autism and the HPV vaccine. I immediately discredited the information as false (not out loud of course) because vaccine facebook groups. He also said because I'm not sexually active that I shouldn't even get the vaccine, and that it's not a true vaccine.

So does the HPV vaccine cause bad side effects in people with autism? Is this a scare tactic that he is doing? Information about this would be greatly appreciated, thank you.

**Recurrent genital warts:**

> The treatment of recurrent acuminated condylomas continues to be a challenge for medicine. Ho reports that 91% of persons eliminate HPV infection in up to 2 years. Ten percent of people do not succeed in eliminating the virus and about 1% of patients present recurrent genital warts.

Source: BCG In the treatment of recurrent Genital condyloma accuminatum

**Factors involved in clearance of genital warts:**

> Number of warts and wart area at presentation were associated with time and number of treatments to clear. Those with 1-3 warts required significantly fewer treatment episodes and less time to clear than those with 11-41 warts, as did those with warts area 2-19 mm2 compared with wart area 100-1038 mm2. 

> The clearance rates in non-smokers compared with smokers were higher, but not significantly different. Wart burden at presentation is an indicator of time to clearance. The number of warts is the best predictor — fewer warts results in earlier clearance.

https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1258/0956462011924407

One more interesting quote:

> Patients with recalcitrant or recurrent severe warts should be evaluated for evidence of other infections (recurrent bacterial, viral, fungal or otherwise unusual or severe); this may be the first indicator of underlying immunodeficiency. History of recurrent infection, frequent antibiotic use since childhood, or autoimmune disease may raise suspicions of underlying immunity impairment. Additionally, family history of immunodeficiency suggests an inherited cause. With personal or family history suggestive of immunodeficiency or in warts persisting for >2 years, consideration of laboratory testing to exclude acquired and inherited forms of immune deficiency should be performed. Testing should include a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, HIV test, antinuclear antibody, and quantitative immunoglobulin assessments. If suspicion remains high and diagnosis elusive, genetic screening (first through a panel, and whole exome/genome sequencing if panel results are inconclusive) may confirm diagnosis (Figure 1).

**How to fight with recurrent genital warts?**

The main advice is: don't suppress your immune system. Quit smoking, quit drinking, don't use drugs. Have a balanced diet. Vaccinate yourself with Gardasil or Gardasil 9 (it won't clear your actual infection, but can be useful in the future).

> Here, we report the cases of 5 male patients (aged 21-58 years) with recalcitrant genital warts who received the Gardasil® 9 vaccine using a 3-dose treatment schedule. The clinical data is summarized in the Table . The mean (± standard deviation) therapy duration of previous warts treatment before Gardasil® 9 administration was 2.60 ± 1.29 years. All patients experienced a decrease in the number of lesions after the third dose of Gardasil® 9 (2.60 ± 1.29 years) (see clinical response in patient no. 2 Figure A, B). No adverse reactions were noted in any of the patients during the 3-dose treatment schedule. Aside from the optimal clinical responses, the patients declared that they were able to cope better with their disease after vaccination, as shown by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), which improved significantly from 12.00 ± 2.12 to 5.80 ± 4.71 (p = 0.0579).

You can also check the study about Imiquimod and Gardasil:

>  The study enrolled 36 subjects aged 26.4 (4.1) years (including 22 men) with one to five condyloma accuminata of the anogenital area. Study participants were vaccinated with human papillomavirus quadrivalent recombinant vaccine using a 0–2–6?month regimen with concomitant administration of imiquimod 5% crème applied three times per week for not more than 16 weeks. Patients were monitored over 2 years. Complete disappearance of condyloma accuminata was observed in 34 out of 36 subjects (94.4%) after 1 year from the start of treatment. Two patients still having condyloma accuminata of the anogenital area after 1 year of combination treatment underwent a successful course of treatment with Solcoderm (one patient for 1 year 3 months and the other for 1 year 4 months), which resulted in complete disappearance of condyloma accuminata. Within 2?year period, no recurrence of condyloma accuminata of the anogenital area has been observed.

**5. Photodynamic Therapy (ALA-PDT)**



> Liang used photodynamic therapy (PDT) with topical application of 20% wt/vol aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride (ALA) in 91 patients. The response rate was close to 100% and  there were fewer side effects than with the CO2 laser. The side-effects in patients treated with ALA-PDT mainly included mild  burning and/or stinging restricted to the illuminated area. Wang studied 56 patients who had cervical lesions and were treated 
with PDT by applying ALA gel (10%) to the surface of the cervix for 4 h followed by irradiation with a 635 nm laser at 100 J cm2.  PDT was repeated at 2-week intervals if the lesion and HPV infection remained. Patients were followed up for 6-24 months. Genotyping analysis revealed four HPV subtypes (HPV6, 11, 16 and 18). The overall complete remission rate of 1-4 sessions of 
treatments was 98.2% and the corresponding HPV clearance rate was 83.9%. Ten cases showed complete removal of cervical lesions and HPV infection after a single treatment. Recurrence rate was 3.6%. Lu studied 40 patients with anogential warts;  after three PDT sessions following surgical curettage, all 40 patients were cured and there was no recurrence at 1 month off 
treatment. At 3 months off treatment, six cases relapsed, corresponding to a recurrent rate of 15%. The satisfaction rate of patients was 100% at 1 month and 95% at 3 months after treatment. Li studied 35 men and found that liquid nitrogen freezing combined with 5-aminolaevulinic acid-photodynamic therapy for condyloma acuminatum in men was effective. In sum, whereas PDT is not a cure all it might be a useful adjuvant to other destructive modalities for the treatment of genital warts

> In conclusion, the presence of a latent infection causes condylomatosis relapse; in order to reduce the relapse risk an induction of a protective immune response seems to be essential to allow rapid viral clearance from genital areas surrounding lesion and treatment zones. Echinacea promotes this process. EP and EA dry root extracts seem to be a valid adjuvant therapy in reducing relapse incidence of lesions in patients treated for genital condylomatosis.

"Ascus Pap 3 months afer leep Hi,

My Pap smear 3 months after leep for low grade lesion due to hpv16 came back as Ascus again (the margins were destroyed). 
Also, I feel some disconfort, like twinges in the cervix.
Could this be from the smear test?
I will wait for the colposcopy results to clarify.
Did anyone here needed a second leep/ckc after the second Ascus pap?

Thank you and good luck to all!"	0
"How I cleared CIN2 and HPV on my own (in 3 months!) I found this page very helpful after my diagnosis and promised myself I would come back and share what I did if I was able to clear CIN 2 on my own. Please do not take this as medical advice. I am just hoping to inspire and reassure others who are in the “wait and see” period.

Last year, I received my first ever abnormal PAP smear and HPV diagnosis. My HPV was positive for E6/7 mRNA, but not HPV 16 or 18/45. Colposcopy with biopsy showed multiple CIN 2 lesions, including the ECC. LEEP was recommended, but I chose to give my body a few months to fight this on its own first. I read countless articles and research regarding spontaneous regression rates and what I could do to improve my odds.

Here is what I did:

1. Stopped taking the birth control pill immediately. Some research suggests that hormonal contraception may make cervical cells more susceptible to HPV. 

*WHO links long term pill use to cervical cancer:* [*https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1122763/*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1122763/)

2. Strict condom use, even with your significant other. Remember: they likely have it too! Your body might be able to fight the infection off easier if it is not constantly re-exposed.

*Condom use promotes regression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and clearance of human papillomavirus: a randomized clinical trial:* [*https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14566832/#:\~:text=Women%20in%20the%20condom%20group,respectively%20(p%20%3D%200.02)*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14566832/#:~:text=Women%20in%20the%20condom%20group,respectively%20(p%20%3D%200.02))*.*

3. I would recommend immediately getting the HPV vaccine for yourself and your partner if you have not. (I already had it many years ago, but my significant other hadn’t)

*Can Adjuvant HPV Vaccination Be Helpful in the Prevention of Persistent/Recurrent Cervical Dysplasia after Surgical Treatment?—A Literature Review* [*https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9496656/*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9496656/)

*HPV vaccine boosts immune memory A single dose of the HPV vaccine can strengthen immune memory in people who’ve previously been infected with HPV — and potentially help prevent re-infection* [*https://www.fredhutch.org/en/news/center-news/2016/08/hpv-vaccine-boosts-immune-memory.html*](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/news/center-news/2016/08/hpv-vaccine-boosts-immune-memory.html)

4.  I took original Papillex and Papillex’s AHCC. (My significant other did also.)

5.  DeflaGyn Vaginal Gel - This medication is hard to come by or even hear about if you are in the USA. It is currently only available in Europe and some other countries. It is supposed to be used for 3 months, but because it took me awhile to figure out how to get it to the US, I was only able to use it for 1 month before my follow up where I found out I was all clear. It is sometimes called “Adsorptive and Antioxidant Vaginal Gel” or “SAM gel” in the research.

6. As many others have stated in this feed, I would of course also recommend eating right, sleeping well, and reducing stress. Ironically enough, this time period was filled with stress and lack of sleep for me personally (due to other reasons), which makes me feel even more strongly about the things listed above!

After only 3 months, I had a repeat colposcopy, biopsy, & HPV test which was completely benign. I was shocked and incredibly grateful. Of course there is no way to know if any of the above things worked or if I got lucky. But personally, I feel that some of these things probably increased my odds of regression. I hope this helps someone feel more in control as they wait! Again, this is just one person’s story. Please consult with your own physician for your case! And thank you to everyone else on here who helped me! :) "	1

RESULTS **Confirmed infection rates increased according to time elapsed since the last immunity-conferring event in all cohorts.** For unvaccinated previously infected individuals they increased from 10.5 per 100,000 risk-days for those previously infected 4-6 months ago to 30.2 for those previously infected over a year ago. **For individuals receiving a single dose following prior infection they increased from 3.7 per 100,000 person days among those vaccinated in the past two months to 11.6 for those vaccinated over 6 months ago.** For vaccinated previously uninfected individuals the rate per 100,000 person days increased from 21.1 for persons vaccinated within the first two months to 88.9 for those vaccinated more than 6 months ago.

CONCLUSIONS **Protection from reinfection decreases with time since previous infection**, but is, nevertheless, higher than that conferred by vaccination with two doses at a similar time since the last immunity-conferring event. **A single vaccine dose after infection helps to restore protection.**"	0

"Men, people with penises and HPV - some myth-busting I wanted to put together a myth-busting post to address some of the common comments, queries, fears and complaints we get at r/hpv on a weekly, if not daily, basis. This post is about both men and people with penises who don't identify as men, but for the purposes of brevity I have just used the word men throughout the post. Please assume '...and people with penises' wherever you see this word. Same for the use of women - please assume '...and people with cervixes' wherever you see this word.

As a bit of context to the post, there is clearly a huge education gap when it comes to HPV, and especially when it comes to men. Although this is a virus that can and does infect literally everybody, it's often seen as 'a women's issue', or something that only women/people with cervixes need to care about. This post serves to dispel this myth, but also to address some of the doom-mongering that can lead some men with HPV infections to feel afraid, depressed and broken. I also want to briefly confront the question of stigma, and 'who has it worst'. 

Disclaimer: not a doctor, not a scientist, just someone who spends too much time on here and likes to be informed. Open to correction if you've got evidence to back it up.

**Myth 1: Men are just carriers of HPV**

This is an interesting one that I see posted from time to time. I think it's something that well-meaning nurses or doctors sometimes say to women who are getting an HPV diagnosis, and may be understandably distressed about having 'given something' to a partner, or vice versa. Additionally, as we'll cover later, the fact that men are not usually tested makes it easy to think of men silently and unwittingly spreading a disease around.

Men are not 'just carriers' of HPV, and men are also not 'the source' of HPV. 

Almost all men and women have HPV infections that, in most cases, cause no symptoms and no harmful problems to arise. These infections are temporary, and while they may pass to sexual partners, it's likely that neither party will ever know. 

In a small number of cases, infections can cause visible symptoms for both men and women. Warts are usually cause by low risk HPV infections, but can also be caused by high risk strains. High risk strains can also (rarely) cause other skin lesions like Bowenoid Papulosis. 

Infections can also persist and cause cell abnormalities that in a small number of cases can develop into cancers. The biggest risk is to those who have cervixes, because the cervix is more susceptible to these changes. However, HPV cancers can also affect the oral region, and less commonly the penis, anus, scrotum, vagina and vulva. 

When we say something like 'men are carriers' for HPV, it implies that men are not affected by HPV, when, although the risk is statistically lower in terms of cancer, they are still vulnerable to HPV-related health issues, and warts can be a huge source of mental distress. It also implies that men are somehow responsible for 'spreading' infection, when the reality is that HPV is pretty much inescapable unless you decide to be fully celibate for life. Thirdly, it erases the importance of HPV awareness for MSM.

Men, women and those of different identities deserve to enjoy and explore sex and love, and we must recognise that although this will never be 'safe', it's also nobody's fault that rubbing our skin together can transmit viruses!

**Men can't get tested for HPV**

The myth: 'there is no test for men for HPV'

The reality: Men can certainly be tested for HPV, it's just not done in most clinical settings. 

This is said with the acknowledgement that in some healthcare systems, testing for men is available and sometimes done fairly routinely. From posts on this forum, this seems to be in certain Eastern European and Asian countries. 

Such testing may be available in private or niche clinics in other healthcare systems where it is not usually offered. 

Of course, scientific studies also make use of testing to examine the prevalence and duration of HPV in male populations. 

But is this something that the ordinary person should pursue? And why is testing not offered as a routine part of sexual health screening?

Let's consider a sexually transmitted infection like chlamydia. It is widespread, especially among young people, but you can reasonably avoid infection by doing two simple things: 1) testing before you get a new sexual partner, which is quick and easy for the most part with a swab or urine test; and 2) using a condom or dental dam during sex to prevent exchange of fluids. If you do have an infection, you can usually pop an antibiotic, send an anonymous message to anyone you had unprotected sex with recently so they can pop an antibiotic, and Bob's your uncle. No more chlamydia. 

Now let's consider HPV. Firstly, if you go to get a urethral swab done, it's testing a tiny, tiny area of your genitals (your urethra). It doesn't tell you about your shaft, balls, anus, inner thighs...all places where HPV could be hanging out, just waiting to hitch a ride onto your next date. 

Secondly, let's say your swab test comes back positive. Uh...what now? There's no treatment for an HPV infection, so the only thing you can do is sit back and wait for it to go. But that might take literally years. And in the meantime, a condom won't fully protect your sexual partners. Are you happy to be fully (and I mean FULLY, like NO TOUCHING) celibate for up to a few years? 

HPV testing for women is a relatively new thing. For example, in the UK where I live, it was only introduced alongside cervical smear tests about 5 years ago. The purpose of HPV testing in this instance is not the same as a chlamydia test - i.e. to treat, treat partners, and prevent onwards transmission. It's a cancer screening tool that helps doctors identify people who need more monitoring. Trying to prevent HPV from spreading would be like trying to get the sand off a beach. 

So, HPV testing for men is both unreliable in its most commonly used form, and clinically pretty useless. 

We also have the reality that everyone has various strains of HPV at any one time, everyone's had previous infections, and we'll probably all have future infections. I'm reminded of a post on here where a well-meaning man had PCR testing from several regions of his genitals, and it came back with a whole list of strains, most of which are probably doing nothing but just hanging out in the skin for a bit. I'm willing to bet if you PCR tested any one of us we'd probably receive a similar result. This young man was feeling dreadful, knowing he had all these infections and thinking about transmitting them to partners. But is he any different from any other guy out there? Does this information help him or his potential partners?

There is perhaps an argument that if men could be tested for the riskiest high risk types (e.g. 16/18) it would give partners a chance to get vaccinated before sex. This would help those of us who perhaps missed out on vaccination due to age, or those whose parents were against it. The medical outlook seems to be 'if you're over 30 (i.e. didn't get vaccinated as a kid) you're on your own lol' - they are more focused on getting teens vaccinated before sexual debut, which to be fair does make utilitarian sense. Basically, if you're reading this and you're not vaccinated, get on it, male, female or other.

There's also an argument to be made for better oral testing/screening/treatments given the rising rates of oral cancers in men. Currently, oral testing is not recommended as cancer prevention because such a tiny % of infections ever become cancerous (Oral Cancer Foundation says 1%) and a test can't tell you whether that will be you or not. Plus, we currently don't have a treatment, so simply finding out you have oral HPV is again kind of useless. Hopefully we will see treatment options such as a therapeutic vaccine in future.

Let's also remember that women are not usually being tested for low risk strains, so it's not just men who don't have access to this facility.

I'm also going to put a note here that anal pap smears are a thing, and given the prevalence of high risk HPV in MSM, these should probably be more widely available and promoted. Anal pap smears have a lot more clinical relevance than urethral swabs, because they can find dysplasia that can then be monitored and treated in a similar way to cervical abnormalities. 

**Men can't clear HPV**

We've had a few posts recently with panicked assertions that 'men can't clear HPV'. 

Let's first address the ambiguity of the word 'clear'. I prefer to say 'immune suppress' because we ultimately don't really know what happens to HPV infections in the body, and 'clear' implies a particular outcome (eradication from the body) which is possible but not proven. 

Anyway, it's simply not true that men do not immune suppress HPV infections. 

There are numerous studies showing that men immune suppress both low and high risk infections. In fact, men are less prone to persistent infections than women.

[https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/493737#:\~:text=Data%20from%20the%20HIM%20Study,MSM%20and%20MSW%20%5B57%5D](https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/493737#:~:text=Data%20from%20the%20HIM%20Study,MSM%20and%20MSW%20%5B57%5D). 

' in men, the median time to clearance of any-HPV infection was 7.5 months, with 66 and 90% of infections clearing within 12 and 24 months respectively '

Where men may be at a disadvantage is in the creation of antibodies, which prevent reinfection. For some reason, male bodies are bad at doing this, so it may take more exposure to a particular strain to make a solid immune response. 

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4907411/#:\~:text=The%20results%20were%20similar%20after,and%20more%20same%2Dsex%20partners](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4907411/#:~:text=The%20results%20were%20similar%20after,and%20more%20same%2Dsex%20partners).

However, this does not mean that all men will have HPV forever. It just means your bodies process the infection in a slightly different way.

**Men have fewer treatment options for HPV**

Unfortunately, this one is partially true. When it comes to wart treatments, Imiquimod is shown to be less effective in men ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11318254/#:\~:text=When%205%25%20imiquimod%20cream%20is,third%20of%20men%20clear%20completely](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11318254/#:~:text=When%205%25%20imiquimod%20cream%20is,third%20of%20men%20clear%20completely)), perhaps because of a slightly difference in immune response. 

Nonetheless, it doesn't mean the outlook is entirely bleak. It may just mean trying a wider range of treatments, or combinations.

**Women carry all the stigma for HPV**

This is an interesting point of debate and in some senses, may be true. HPV testing, as we mentioned earlier, is a relatively new thing when it comes to routine screening, and education definitely hasn't caught up. This leaves many women confused and upset at a diagnosis they weren't expecting, and the idea of having an STI can really feel like a devastating thing when you've been brought up to think that a sexually transmitted infection is a sign of dangerous, unhealthy or immoral behaviour. Similarly, when women disclose to male partners, there can be shock, upset and judgement, again because of the education gap. 

On the other hand, men are not being tested but also have HPV infections, and usually only those who have visible warts or other lesions are aware of them. There is a lot of stigma on those men, so to try to say one side has it worse than the other is perhaps unfair. 

What's clear is that, rather than engaging in stigma Olympics, there are a few things we need to address on a societal and cultural level:

1. An understanding that HPV affects LITERALLY EVERYONE and is therefore not a 'women's issue'
2. An appreciation that an HPV diagnosis is not weird, abnormal, disgusting or a sign of poor behaviour - it's an unavoidable part of being human
3. A wider movement for vaccination, including in adulthood, for men as well as women
4. A push for more effective and easily available treatment for those already infected - including men"	0

"CMV: This sub isn’t a place for debate and is just as much of an echo chamber as the pro-vaccination sub-Reddits it attempts to distance itself from. It should be renamed “anti-vaccines.” For example, I have been making the odd post and comment here as someone who is pro-vaccination and all of my posts and comments are heavily downvoted without even being replied to despite my effort in making them and finding reliable, scientific sources. When I am replied to it is usually with people labelling me a worker of big pharma (whom I am also cynical towards) rather than debate me. This trend seems to apply to all of the other pro-vaccination posts here.

Doesn’t this suggest that very little debate is actually occurring on this sub and that this subreddit is losing its right to criticise the media for suppressing information and fearmongering when its users also suppress measured pro-vaccination perspectives and regularly upvote unreliable and biased sources as well as vague and emotionally-manipulative news stories about people who died after vaccination without the cause of death being released? Does anyone feel similarly?

Just to add that I don’t pretend in any of my posts that the vaccines aren’t without risk, though side effects are incredibly rare and rarer than in many medications like aspirin or the pill, but I state that there is an undeniable (from scientific studies) net benefit to receiving them when compared to  an unvaccinated covid infection (which we still know very little about compared to these cases of research on MRNA vaccines)."	1

"A different perspective on anti vaxxers? Don't get me wrong, vaccination is important, and has saved millions, that's not doubt-able, but I think anti vaxxers are mostly just good people that have good intentions, like 9/11 conspirators, who genuinely believe the government was at least somewhat involved in 9/11, and justice needs to be served, although they are wrong, they have good intentions mostly, or largely at least.

I think this is where the issue lies, (and I know it sounds shocking at first, just hear me out all the way) at least partially. It's that the CDC, themselves, admit that vaccines cause autism, and brain damage, and to some people, this causes a knee jerk reaction, to not vaccinate, or to think vaccines are bad, and the truth is, a few people getting brain damaged by vaccines, is far better than hundreds or thousands getting brain damaged, or killed by measles, or polio.

The reason, the CDC doesn't want people to know vaccines cause autism, is not because they're evil, it's because they know that this will cause massive fear, and make people irrationally stop vaccinating! 

A quote from Dr Richard Kelly who worked for the CDC was ''I agree with the CDC's statement on autism and vaccines as a public health measure, but not scientifically.''

Dr Paul Offit says ''We can't actually say vaccines don't cause autism, but we have to get used to saying it, because if we leave that door open, people will disproportionately react and we will see massive drops in vaccination!''

So basically, I think that vaccines can cause autism, but the chances of them doing so, and the complications of autism, are far less than the chances and complications of being injured or killed by diseases like measles, or diptheria."	1
"Credible Sources to Diagnose VP vs HPV I have a passion for research probably due to my autism. I have two college degrees and work in the allied health field. My advanced degree is in diagnostics. This means I’m educated enough to know the process a medical doctor is taking to diagnose his patient. My story is that I was misdiagnosed with HPV genital warts. I got second opinions, treatments, and a biopsy. This sunk me into the deepest depression of my life with panic attacks. Most significantly, I was gaslighted by healthcare professionals. The key question that revealed this was when I asked, “Have you ever heard of vestibular papillomatosis?” The answer was the same which was some version of “no” coupled with the vibe of having no interest either. I had my research papers in hand and offered them in which they didn’t even glance at them and they never accepted them… except for one Dermatology Nurse Practitioner. He took my papers and listened to me. He could not treat me as his office refers out to gynecology for these situations. But he guided me on what tests to ask for, etc. With his help, I was able to prove that I was misdiagnosed as my biopsy came back negative for HPV. What I have is vestibular papillomatosis, a benign and normal condition.

So I am creating this thread to post all my research on the topic. I realize now that I have a talent and skill level for finding credible research that even many doctors do not as evidenced by my situation. They are supposed to, it is irresponsible that they do not. I have been through hell and am taking vengeance on healthcare. My vengeance is to empower others who are facing a similar situation, so they can be their own health advocates and diagnosticians. If you have a brain and are willing to learn, you too can become more educated on the topic than the average medical doctor. If you are reading this than you are ahead of the game. 

I will make a response post here with links to all the research. Just give me time to compile it.

"WHO Says Anti-Vaxxers Are Global Health Threat WHO Says Anti-Vaxxers Are Global Health Threat

- https://www.webmd.com/children/vaccines/news/20190117/who-says-anti-vaxxers-are-global-health-threat  

Anti-vaxxers are among the top 10 health threats facing the world in 2019, the World Health Organization says.  

The movement against vaccinations has taken hold in a number of countries, including the United States. The percentage of American children aged 19 to 35 months who have not been vaccinated has quadrupled since 2001, according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, Newsweek reported.  

A growing number of people in many U.S. states are anti-vaccination, according to a recent study in the journal PLoS One.  

""Since 2009, the number of 'philosophical-belief' vaccine non-medical exemptions has risen in 12 of the 18 states that currently allow this policy: Arkansas, Arizona, Idaho, Maine, Minnesota, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas and Utah,"" the study authors wrote, Newsweek reported.  

The other top 10 global health threats include: air pollution and climate change; non-communicable diseases such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes; global flu pandemic; antimicrobial resistance; Ebola and other highly dangerous pathogens; weak primary health care; dengue; HIV; and lack of access to basic health care.

"ALPHA MALE (HOW TO DISCLOSE LOW RISK HPV) What can i say ? 30 year old male, ex-marine, disabled veteran and now three letter federal agency employee. On the outside looking in, I'm perfect! Three degrees, Nice European Automobile and as of today,"" squamous papilloma"" or for a more layman term genital warts.

I  don't understand. I've had twenty- four life time female partners. Until last year, I've never dated a woman who wasn't involved in the military. I've not used a condom only once.

More so, this wart I thought was a skintag was on the base of my penis since 2015!! During 2015 until now, I've seen numerous doctors for full body physicals and told by two physicians who even cared to point it out that this solitary growth was a mole or skin tag. The only reason I'm at this point is because of my new partner who is my old GF. She clearly said, I didn't remember this being there in 2014 and wanted me to get it checked out. No problem we locate a doctor out of my network to take a look (Fresh eyes). She says, def a mole. However, we can do a biopsy, I said okay!

&#x200B;

8/3/2020. Special Agent \*\*\*\*  you have a call. I say thanks, Pick up the phone, well you have squamous papilloma, compatible with condyloma. She told me she thinks I contracted the wart through oral sex. I said really! She says yes, these specific warts are often found in the mouth. I ask, so what's next, she says nothing. You only had one. I said should I notify my partners she said no need and HPV is every where. I said I now have to get use to disclosing this condition to every new partner. She then says that's your choice. I said choice? She said yes, there is nothing on the books saying you have to disclose, HPV. She hangs up!

I'm immediately pissed. This is how, I'm sure I contracted HPV! Some federal government GS-13 physician probably told a female  not to worry about disclosing. My ex who started dating me again took the news well, to well. She told me she's been with twice the partners I have..... and is sure she's come in contact with HPV before never being vaccinated.... (We are def wearing protection, that surprised me).

I'm bummed over this. I like smart, intelligent, wholesome women that I hope to marry one day. And before this encounter I thought my Ex was this. However, obviously I'm wrong. Now I feel like I should lower my standards or not be as judgmental

just be happy in the future someone will date me.. Four deployments and 10 years in the core  and I've never felt like I've failed a mission until now!

And if I do have sex and wear a condom with the wart not present. How long can I keep that up it's 2020 and no one wears condoms. Concerns will be raised! But then again not disclosing isn't ethical ad ethics is my lie. Plus I have a little wealth, I'm sure I'll be sued and probably have my clearance revoked, If a woman say's she's contracted this from me! Shit I'm going crazy.

"Can I have oral sex? Can I give oral sex? Your HPV guide to giving and getting head Oral sex is a very common subject of concern here on r/hpv, so I thought I'd put together a quick primer post for those who have been diagnosed with HPV infection, or whose partners are affected.

As a quick note, it feels like people obsess over oral because they believe using condoms for PIV is protective against HPV (unfortunately only mitigates but doesn't prevent transmission), and so oral presents a somewhat greater risk. The reality is more complex.

**I've been diagnosed with HPV.**

Hi, welcome to the human race. Remember that [80%+](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6745688/) of people will get genital HPV at least once by age 45 - and most of them won't know it. So, in some ways, you don't need to feel particularly worried about anything you do or don't choose to do. HPV is going to find you and your partners at some point. However, on a personal and individual level, STIs can bring a huge amount of anxiety and it's understandable that we want to at least feel like we are doing our best to safeguard ourselves and our partners.

**I have a cervical HPV infection. Can I give oral sex?**

Getting an HPV diagnosis through a cervical smear is the most likely way to find out you have HPV. It's important to understand that a cervical smear only tells you about your cervix. It can't tell you about any other body part. So, it's very possible to have a concurrent oral infection (and remember that most oral infections are asymptomatic - a sore throat is much more likely to be caused by another common infection like cold or strep).

However, on the other hand, oral infections are suppressed fairly quickly in general (see here - [72% of oral infections in young men went within 4 months](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4375438/)), so having something on your cervix doesn't mean anything is in your mouth. Additionally, remember that any person your partner meets could have an oral infection right now and would have no idea. So, with these facts in mind, you and your partner might conclude that it's not a particularly huge risk for you to give them oral sex, given that you most likely don't have an oral infection and are not putting them at any more risk than anyone else they might meet.

**I have a cervical HPV infection. Can I receive oral sex?**

This, conversely, is a more worrying point. See this [article](https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-022-01965-x).

*Mainly because of effective screening, the incidence of cervical cancer in the western society is decreasing (7.4 per 100,000). As* ***over 70% of OPSCCs are attributable to HPV,*** *in the US they are now* ***the most frequent HPV-related cancer***\*, having overtaken cervical cancer \[[*11*](https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-022-01965-x#ref-CR11)\]. It has been estimated that by 2030 the majority of all mucosal squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck will be HPV-related ...\* *Such a sharp increase in HPV-related OPSCCs mainly affects men (7.8 per 100,000)*

*Although the natural history of the transition to oropharyngeal cancer is not fully clarified, it is now commonly accepted that* ***a subclinical oral HPV infection persisting for 10–30 years*** *is an obligate precursor of the majority of OPSCCs*

With this in mind, there is some risk to your partner (particularly if male) if they give you oral sex and contract your infection.

Interestingly:  *Some investigators suggest that* ***performing oral sex on female genitalia (i.e., a mucosal surface) leads to a higher transmission rate of infection as compared to the transmission occurred when performing oral sex on male genitalia,*** *because of the keratinized epithelium of the penis. In addition, it has been suggested that the keratinized epithelium of the penis is more resistant to HPV infection than the epithelium of the cervix*

However, this risk will be lower if you are vaccinated: (from the article) ***HPV 16 accounting for 70–80% of cases***

If you are vaccinated, then you may both conclude that the relative risk is still low. Even better - you are both vaccinated!

You may also decide to use barrier methods like condoms and dental dams for oral. There isn't good data on how well these protect partners, but it's likely they would mitigate the risks.

**I have a cervical HPV infection and I have a long-term partner with whom I've been giving and receiving oral sex regularly. Do we need to stop?**

People in regular partnerships don't need to stop having sex. This is because you will already share your infection. This includes oral sex.

However, studies show that using [condoms for vaginal sex](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6679446/) can help the body deal with cervical abnormalities because of a lower viral load. So, it's theoretically possible that this could also be the case when using barrier methods orally. If you have (or could have) HPV16, the riskiest kind when it comes to oral cancer, this might be one way to lower the viral load for your partner.

You partner may also want to consider getting vaccinated. For men in particular, [seroconversion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4680989/#:~:text=In%20this%20multinational%20study%20of,developed%20detectable%20serum%20HPV%20antibodies) is less likely, making them susceptible to catching the same strain more than once. If you could have a vaccine strain then this could be a good idea to further safeguard them.

**I have genital warts. Can I give oral sex?**

As above, visible warts on your genitals do not tell you anything about your mouth. If you don't have visible oral warts (which are about half as common as genital warts, anyway) then again, you are the same as anyone else they might meet who could also have an asymptomatic oral infection.

**I have genital warts. Can I receive oral sex?**

There is a risk that your partner will get an oral HPV infection. This is not to say they would ever develop warts - they may never even know. The majority of warts are caused by the low risk strains that don't cause cancer, but in some cases can either be caused by or have coinfection with high risk strains, so you may want to consider using some of the safety methods (barriers and vaccination) mentioned above.

**I'm never going to get oral sex again!!!1!!11!one**

It's very likely that, no matter your situation, you can indeed get back to a full sex life, including oral sex, at some point soon.

Remember that the majority of HPV infections are transient; that although we don't fully understand transmission risks past immune control, almost everyone has a prior infection, so nobody is any different to you; and that we are all exposed to HPV many times in our lives.

Partners can get vaccinated, you can use barrier methods and abstain for a time, or partners may conclude that the relative risk is low enough that they simply don't mind.

There are lots of ways to give your partner a mindblowing orgasm that don't involve oral so, if you decide to take a break, perhaps it's an opportunity to experiment with these.

**What can I and my partner do to lower our oral cancer risks?**

At the moment, oral HPV testing is not commonly offered in most places, nor is it recommended by the [Oral Cancer Foundation](https://oralcancerfoundation.org/understanding/hpv/hpv-oral-cancer-facts/):

*Although there are many adjunctive oral cancer screening devices and tests, currently* ***none*** *of them can find HPV positive oral and oropharyngeal cancers early. There are oral HPV infection tests on the dental market, and while they will find an oral HPV infection which as many as 26 million Americans have on any given day, (NHANES study, ongoing), that is no indicator that a person will cascade into an oral/oropharyngeal cancer. The foundation feels that while these tests find infections through a well-recognized testing protocol (PCR testing), since only about 1% of individuals that develop a high risk type oral HPV infection ever cascade into cancer, and that most often occurs decades after infection, that* ***the utility of the test is highly in question when in it comes to providing meaningful and actionable information***\*.\*

*The best way to screen for HPV related oral and oropharyngeal cancer today is through* ***a visual and tactile exam given by a medical or dental professional***\*, who will also do an oral history taking to ask about signs and symptoms that cover things that are not visible or palpable.\*

In other words, go to your dentist regularly and ask for a cancer screening when you do so.

It's also important to keep up your general health and avoid [smoking](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6752112/).

Otherwise, as there's not a lot you can do, imo it's wise to try to release anxiety on this point.

"Dr. Jacque Commentary 8/8/24 2Q Earnings Call re: 3107/Cellectra dispenser disposable part: the replacement of the defective disposable part may not delay as long as that- worst case it may delay approval until 2 Q 25 if redosing is delayed- if redosing proves effective would be sooner **INOVIO (NASDAQ:**[**INO**](http://www.barchart.com/quotes/INO)**),** a biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing DNA medicines to help treat and protect people from HPV-related diseases, cancer, and infectious diseases, recently [announced](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inovio-reports-second-quarter-2024-200500456.html) its financial results for the second quarter of 2024 and provided an update on recent company developments.

 

“We continue to make progress with our lead candidate, INO-3107, which has the potential to significantly improve the lives of patients with RRP. 

We expect all non-device related elements of our BLA package to be completed by year end and our pre-BLA meeting last week with the FDA provided us with confidence that we remain on the right track for the regulatory submission. 

However, as part of the testing process required for BLA submission, we’ve recently identified a manufacturing issue with the single use disposable administration component of our device that we believe is resolvable, but will take additional time to rectify,” said Dr. Jacqueline Shea, INOVIO’s President and Chief Executive Officer. 

“We’re taking corrective steps to address the issue, and while we have not altered our ultimate expectations for INO-3107 to be a potentially transformative therapeutic option for RRP patients that could be the first DNA medicine approved for use in the United States, we now expect to be able to submit the BLA in mid-2025. 

We will continue to work hard to advance all other elements necessary for INO-3107’s success, including working to initiate our confirmatory trial, advancing plans for our redosing trial, making key regulatory progress in Europe and the U.K., and continuing commercial preparations to be launch-ready if we receive approval. These efforts will help maintain the momentum that’s carried us from Breakthrough Therapy Designation to BLA preparation in less than a year.”"	1

"Why Do Vaccine Deniers Care? I'm not getting the vaccine, ever. I'm fact, I'm not getting any vaccine ever again. I don't believe in ""viruses"" or ""immune systems"". I can share why of someone asks, but I don't see the point in trying to convince people outside of your immediate circle. 

YEAAAAHHHH we know the mainstream media is lying but, if you watch the mainstream news you have larger problems than a vaccine passport 

What y'all should be focusing on is the supply chain and the fraudulent election.

Edit: If your point is that you are sounding the alarm because they could make it mandatory then I have even les s sympathy for you. The person that would make that argument is like a person making an argument why we need a conservative supreme Court. They would say that we need to protect the Second amendment. The supreme Court doesn't protect the Second amendment! You protect the Second amendment. No one else."	-1
"Having unprotected sex with Cin 1 I’ve been seeing this guy and I told him about about me having HPV. He questioned it a little and then seemed unbothered- we were good on condoms until one night we were getting intimate and all of a sudden it’s in. I jumped. I told him that he shouldn’t do that and to always wear a condom. 
I guess he didn’t think it was that big of a deal. I’m freaking out because now he has or probably has the kind of strain I have which is high risk related to cervical cancer. 

How do I tell him without scaring him off? I read it can take a few times for a man to contract?? 
Is there a chance that he is still ok? I’m just so worried and feel awful.

My dad who lives with us is refusing to get tdap vaccine to protect the baby. My father lost his job right at the beginning of the pandemic, and moved in with me and my husband until he got back on his feet. Well.. it’s 2 years later and he is still unemployed (for the lack of trying), so I though at least he could help me with my baby that’s due in 2 months. Now he is refusing to get the tdap vaccine to protect the baby. I’m at the wit’s end with him. Any suggestions as to what would be the best approach?	1
"My grandma is really old and I'm scared My grandma is in her late 80s and I'm scared.

On one hand I'm scared of her getting covid. On the other, after me and my sister (who are both in our early 20s) got the second dose of the vaccine and were bedridden I'm scared I could lose my grandma if she takes the vaccine.

As u can tell I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place."	-1
"Appeals to the consensus of the pharmaceuticals, CDC, FDA, and WHO, are crap, as far as actual evidence goes. They have a history of corruption. So, we can't trust them by appeal of authority (and we should never, appeal to authority, at least not as a isolated reasoning). We actually have to look at the evidence they give, and often it's not convincing from any skeptical perspective. 

I trust the CDC when they have no reason to lie, but otherwise, I'm highly skeptical of their claims, as with their position, any old garbage can be written down and made to look like established fact to the gullible or conformative types.

Often, their own studies don't even conclude the same conclusion as is pushed in media and consensus. 

For example ""vaccines don't cause autism"" - study says ""we tested one ingredient of 50, 1 vaccine of 16, short term, unrigorously, and haven't found anything to accept or reject a link"". 

And that's not even taking into account the awful trap which is the healthy user bias.

Anyway, until there is a fair, unbiased system in place to properly anaylse cost benefit outcomes of macro scale vaccination, individual vaccines, and specific outcomes of vaccination on an individual level, then I'm not going to vaccinate. And the fact that there isn't, is a massive fucking issue. Whether or not vaccines are saving more than they kill, is unknown, but it makes me suspect, the fact that they don't have a system in place, on whether, at the very least, they are trying to hide the truth that vaccines aren't nearly as beneficial to public health as is commonly believed."	0
"Cold hard truth about hpv I got HPV from my wife (soon to be ex wife). I have had one wart on my scrotum for several years. I was in denial and convinced myself it was a skin tag from friction because I am a runner. Well it started getting bigger a few months back and some more popped up on the other side of my scrotum and inner thigh. I went to the doctor and they scheduled excision surgery. 

Knowing the facts about hpv I knew if I didn’t change something they would just come back. So I researched everything I could and just a few days ago I changed everything about my diet. I started taking multivitamins, odorless garlic, reishi mushrooms, and vitamin B12. I used to eat one time a day which was probably a frozen pizza or other processed food. I would drink atleast 6 beers a night and smoke like a chimney. 

After three days of not drinking alcohol (I still smoke but I have decreased the amount I smoke) and eating organic grapes for breakfast, brussel sprouts, salad, broccoli, yogurt with flax seed and honey, taking all the supplements, and working out. The massive wart is turning black and seems to be dying. I feel the infection being killed already. Mind you it’s only been 3 days since I started this. My surgery is scheduled in 2 weeks. 

I can feel my body working again and I must say it feels great. I can feel my immune system kicking in everyday I wake up. My muscles are more defined, I breath so much easier while working out, my mood is uplifted, I have more energy and I find myself smiling more. It’s true what you hear, if you eat like shit and party to hard and you have hpv 6 or 11, your immune system is compromised and you will develop genital warts. 

Your immune system will completely kill the infection when it is functioning properly. In order to do that you must make lifestyle changes. The surgery’s and creams and apple cider and everything else might work to remove the warts but you are still infected and they will come back unless you fix your body. It’s the cold hard truth and it took me several years to come to terms with it. I hope this helps.

"HSIL Timeline & Homeopathic Treatment Hi, all!

Here is my timeline to HSIL:

2021- LSIL Pap, Colposcopy w/ no biopsy and no visible lesions. (Unsure about HPV results)

2022- ASCUS Pap, Colposcopy w/ small visible lesion and biopsy. Biopsy showed totally normal results. (HPV negative)

2023- Normal Pap

2024- HSIL Pap, waiting for colposcopy in one month. (The nurse who called me said there were no HPV results listed on my lab work ??)

I know HSIL can be a range of CIN 2 to CIN 3, but is it also how cancer would be labeled during a routine Pap smear? I know the likelihood of cancer at this point is low, just curious.

I have a colposcopy in a month, but has anyone successfully reversed HSIL using supplements/ diet? I fully plan to do whatever is needed (LEEP/ CKC, etc.) but a month is a long time to wait so I figured supplements won’t hurt.

After my abnormal pap in 2022 I began taking supplements and had a normal biopsy despite  visible lesion.

Before my pap in 2023 I took some of the same supplements and had a normal reading.

This year I didn’t take the supplements and had an HSIL pap.

I can’t find the exact website I used to guide my supplement purchases, but I think it is similar to the supplements below. Have these supplements worked for anyone else? Any other recommendations?

"Kurzgesagt video anaylsis: Not what you first thought. 
https://youtu.be/zBkVCpbNnkU

There are many things this video fails to explain and make clear:

The fact that 95% of the deaths from these diseases that vaccines prevent, are ones that occur in the poverty ridden LEDC's like yemen, parts of india, ethiopia... etc.. And most of the people that are watching the video, are from HEDC's like Canada, UK, U.S, Sweden, Norway, Japan, Australia, Germany, Italy... So the statistics they're giving are not relevant to the people who are watching the video. This makes it look as though the vaccines are saving thousands of times (YES THOUSANDS!) more lives than they actually are in most of the countries of the people who are watching the video! 

The fact that the estimates used to determine the number of lives saved, is grossly bias-ly constructed. Here's one example: CDC'S own graphs make unsubstantiated improbable conclusions. [https://imgur.com/gallery/XfoZmAn](https://imgur.com/gallery/XfoZmAn) 

The fact that there is not a single system in place to capture vaccine caused deaths and injuries, outside of the opinion of the one who makes the diagnosis. So, many vaccine injuries, and deaths, are captured under the labels of ''sudden infant death'' ''Damage to the brain'' ''unknown natural cause'' ''damage to the nervous system''.

Harvard predicts that 15,000-70,000 deaths occur each year in the USA alone, from vaccines. (Source: HHS, VAERS, NVICP)

"Why aren’t we making a flu vaccine for the current bird flu? Seems like a no brainer to manufacture a vaccine for the current H5N1 strain in case it acquires additional mutations for human to human spread. There’ll likely be some kind of immunity even if it’s not perfectly matching a strain that has mutated. Are flu vaccine committees looking into this? It could be rolled into this fall’s seasonal vaccine schedule. As far as I know the technology has already been developed and approved.

"So, my mom is an anti-vax... My mom started becoming an anti-vax quite a couple months ago (completely out of the blue, probably when someone just started going full anti-vax mode in a random Zalo (Vietnamese equivalent to WhatsApp) group with a bunch of 82'ers in it and posted videos of people randomly falling in the streets of China calling it death by vaccine). The first time I took notice of it is when my mom asked me to sign her up for Telegram and join a supposedly Vietnamese group (which turns out to have a herd of anti-vaxxers). Since then she went full psycho and decided to ask every single person that she meets if they have been vaccinated - which she will probably advice them not to take any further jabs and shit like that.

Until she started to tell me not to take the vaccines and showing videos of people falling on the streets in China and random people protesting in Europe (probably the 2018? French protests). I just decided to practice my debating skills (since I'm in a debate club) and counter each and every of her arguments, which she would either respond with ""Shut the fuck up"" or throwing some other insults at my face. Yeah, I actually insulted her once and she was really pissed (and **constantly** bugged me **every single god damn fucking time** about it also).

Oh yeah, she also believes in **already debunked** fake news (like Japanese government banning microwave ovens and nanochips/nanobots in the COVID vaccines). My response to those is just to organize raids on Telegram with my friend on those groups as an effort to disrupt those info (which was absolutely hilarious when people asking for admins' help in vain)

Now obviously she won't believe in actual news sources and instead believes in random 40-year-old self-proclaimed ""doctors"" and trying to throw money on my face if I **don't take the COVID test and the vaccine...**"	1
"Frustrated with nurse friend Ok I’m new to this subreddit so I apologize if this kid of post is not welcome. I had a frustrating experience the other night while my husband was on the phone with some friends of ours. They told us they were expecting a baby and we all started catching up on speakerphone. Keep in mind these friends are lifelong Texans.

Im not sure how vaccines became the topic but the friend’s wife, who is a nurse, started telling is about how all the virologists at her hospital are refusing the vaccine because they say it is too dangerous. Then she starts telling us that she will never get the vaccine. She told us that she has been seeing tons of miscarriages at her hospital and most of the woman who miscarry are vaccinated. As I’m listening to this, i just start to shake my head with disbelief. 

Now we haven’t seen these friends in a while, and they are more my husbands friends than my own, so I’m not about to get into a vaccine debate over speaker phone. But it really frustrated me that this nurse is taking her personal experience and basically conflating it into her own made up study. I know that questioning her reasoning would lead to her saying something along the lines of “i work in healthcare so i know  the truth way more than you would”. I just stayed quiet but then went on a tirade to my husband after the call was over.

Im not saying she is lying or that her experience isn’t valid. But she is not a medical research scientist, she has not conducted tests on these women to prove exactly what caused the miscarriages, and she is clearly looking to affirm her biases by pointing to the vaccines being the cause of the miscarriages. She didn’t ask these women if they had covid recently or of they suffer from long-covid. She is making a huge assumption based off of her own opinion. Not to even mention stress and depression (which are rampant) playing a large role in the success of a pregnancy.

From what I’ve seen in research studies, adverse effects from the vaccines (while not 0%) are significantly more rare than the adverse effects of having covid as an unvaccinated person. Also, from what i have read, the miscarriage rate is already surprisingly high (around 1 in 3 pregnancies end in miscarriage) so it is no surprise that there would be a large portion of vaccinated women who also go on to have miscarriages. The correlation does not equal causation. And its not this nurse’s place to be making such bold assertions.

Most doctors highly recommend pregnant women get vaccinated, because covid is incredibly dangerous for pregnant women and has caused many birth complications. Covid can affect oxygen saturation, which is a very dangerous thing for a fetus which needs oxygen to survive. Not to mention, pregnancy suppresses the immune system, making pregnant women more vulnerable to sickness all together. 

Im not sure why I’m so upset by what this friend said. I guess mostly due to her putting her own pregnancy at risk, but I’m also upset that she thinks she has the authority of a medical research scientist. It really bothers me when people who work in healthcare have an inflated sense of authority over something they are not an expert in, and only have anecdote-based opinions. Im sure she preaches her opinions to all of her friends. 

So should i have called her out or was it wise to not press it?"	1
"Baby around unvaccinated kids? I want to start this off by saying that I’m in a state where measles has made a comeback thanks to antivaxxer parents. 
I have a newborn and I feel REALLY uneasy about taking them around kids that I know are unvaccinated, I’m wondering if anyone else has dealt with this situation and how did you handle it? 
My baby has siblings that are unvaccinated and people are asking me when I’m going to allow them to meet the baby. I also found out that the school the siblings attend recently had a measles exposure. My partners family doesn’t take vaccines seriously, his ex and mother of his kids is obviously an antivaxxer, and another close member of the family asked if I “had done my research” when he mentioned we had taken the baby in to the Pediatrician and she received a vaccine. This is stressing me out, and idk who to ask about this so here I am. Thanks. "	0

Do Holistic OBGYN Doctors/Nurses Ever Tell Patients Not To Get Vaxxed? My husband and I are TTC and my mom is very vaccine hesitant/antivax and will not get the COVID vaccine. This is a big bummer, but she will not budge on it and I want her in our life when our newborn comes. It would be devastating if I had to keep her away from the baby until they can get their vaccines, but I would definitely put my baby's life before anything. The vaccine that is non-negotiable for me for visitors with our newborn is TDAP, and after some conflict with her, she agreed to talk to her (holistic) OBGYN about this. They are essentially an OBGYN that offers midwifery, holistic approaches, etc, and I'm sure they are great but I am a little nervous. I imagine anyone who is a practicing doctor or nurse would advocate for being up to date on TDAP to be around a newborn - am I off base here? Are there doctors out there that will tell her not to do it or tell her it's optional?	0

Children of antivaxxers driving me crazy Ok I am a teacher and the children of antivaxxers are driving me crazy. To be clear, I don’t blame them, it’s the parents’ fault, but wow they are making my life so much more difficult. They come to school with all these insane ideas they tell the other children. I can try to get them to stop talking and focus on their work but I’m fighting a losing battle here (especially being an English teacher; discussions are a big part of the curriculum and of course I can’t keep them all on-topic all the time). And I can’t really talk to them about the vaccine other than telling them I personally chose to get vaccinated and boosted because if they tell their parents something I said that the parents don’t like and they parents complain I could get fired for actually educating the children on vaccines! What a concept, teaching give children accurate information on current events that have a direct impact on their lives. Children have told me I will turn into a vampire or an alien because I am vaccinated. One kid has convinced several others that the vaccine not only doesn’t protect you from COVID but that it actually weakens your immune system’s ability to fight other illnesses. The unvaccinated children gang up on the vaccinated ones and make fun of them, telling them the same shit, that the kid is going to turn into a mutant or get cancer or something. And Lord knows kids may not be afraid of much but they are afraid of cancer. So I’ve had to deal with that drama from the vaccinated kids who they have given anxiety. Oh and now I think I have omicron. A lot of the students have been out sick and some of those who have stuck around have had pretty suspicious “allergies”. Fortunately I only have very mild symptoms (because of the vaccine!!) but I need to get tested tomorrow before school. In conclusion, I’m at my wit’s end. Work is harder than ever and it’s only getting worse as more and more teachers are quitting. Wonder why!!	1
Will it ever be generally accepted that the vaccines didn't work, and it was a fail? I have a lot of heated debates with my jabbed friends. I keep telling them: you'll find out.	1
"Some hope :) I tested positive for high risk HPV 8 years ago. 

At the 5 year mark my doctors said “you might be a lifer”.  I accepted this as I knew my doctors would never allow it to progress to cancer and I would be okay.  It was just an inconvenience to have additional appts and spending money on biopsies and such. 

On the 6th year, I tested negative. On the 7th year, I tested negative. And now on year 8, I have tested negative again. 3 years of normal paps and 3 years of testing negative for 14 high risk strands. 

I am now able to go back to a routine schedule of paps.  3-5 years!! 

I just want anyone to know if you went past the 2 year mark that it’s just an average and your body just may need to take a little longer to figure it out.   I may add that I was in my early 30s before getting that negative result.

I’m beyond excited to have finally made it to this point after so many years and I hope you all get there too ??"	1

"I have gw and no idea how i got them (english isnt my first language) My boyfriend (21M) and i (20F) used to go to motels a lot and have unprotected sex since i got an IUD (must say he was a virgin when we met) Everything was fine until a few months ago i noticed one small weird thing in my genital area that looked like a white pimple and commited the mistake of ripping it out, it bled a little but i thought the problem was solved and since then i started noticing the warts, which became more and more till i finally went to see my gyno who said i had HPV.
Im guessing it was the motel towels but im not sure its possible, since she and the dermatologist that made me go through cryotherapy said its only possible to get it through sexual transmission. The dermatologist also diagnosed me with molluscum contagiosum, saying i have both, but i havent gone through any exams, it has all been through what they saw, so i dont really know..
Im also worried about the cryotherapy since after i had my first session most warts grew back in the same place, im waiting for the next session but ive seen comments saying it always grow back and im really worried.
My bf wants to keep having unprotected sex (he's also used to finishing inside) and isnt worried about the warts, he thinks it doesnt matter anyway since he most likely already has the virus too, but wont show signs, but im worried that keep having unprotected sex will make me keep growing warts.
Im disgusted with my own body and genitals now, we even had fights about my previous partners thinking someone gave me the virus and i just started showing symptoms recently, so i secretly talked to all the people ive had sex with in the past and none of them have warts nor any symptoms of STDs. Im pretty sure it was the motels, but is it really possible? am i going to keep this forever? should i stop having unprotected sex with my partner who as i said, was a virgin, and is now completely used to not using condoms and finishing inside? i know he would do it if i asked him to, but i also know he wont like it at all..
i just want to get rid of these things, help"	-1
Am I at risk for contracting HPV? I am pregnant, and my sister recently gave me all of her maternity clothes. She has had HPV for about a year and had a pretty severe breakout of several warts during her pregnancy. I'm wondering if it's okay to use the maternity clothes she gave me? Obviously no underwear. But I'm worried about using pants for sure, but even shirts have me feeling anxious. I washed everything obviously. But does that really get rid of the virus? She also gave me a stomach wedge pillow. I'm pretty sure she sleeps naked or just in underwear. Is that going to be safe to use?	0
"Think I just gave myself a STD? (genital warts) So I have two roomates and they both go to gym a lot. Yesterday they come home after coming to the gym and come into my room and start petting the cat... Just so you know I doubt they even washed their hands at all since leaving to go the gym so theres potential warts from the equipment, themselves, and all the other stuff they are touching thats got other peoples sweat and HPV (potentially genital HPV) viruses on them.

Okay so I stay calm and wait for them to leave. For some reason i do something stupid and start patting the cat as well, right in the same places where they were just patting her for like 5-10 mins straight.

I think oh well i just need to remember to wash my hands before I do anything else... Except I feel asleep. I woke up 3 hr later tired and I notice that my shorts are in am uncomfortable position so i put my hands into my shorts to readjust them in the process I touch my genitals (testicles) for about 4 or 5 seconds.

I realize after that I never washed my hands after patting the cat when I feel asleep. Its too late for a shower. I try to go back to sleep but i end up dreaming about the virus and I wake up and I try to find something and I put an alcohol wipe on my testicles. I have a shower the next day approx 12 hours after this.

They go to the gym a lot so this is something i have be conscious of all the time and sometimes i slip up like i did last night... Anyway this whole thing got me feeling depressed today because of this exposure and thinking about what next is going to happen, bcos as i type this theyre at the gym again and will be home soon..."	-1

IF vaccines are...lets say the opposite of safe, how come the majority of vaxxed people are not dead or have any issues, pretty much every single vaccinated person I know from young to p;d has never been seriously ill or died. 

If you make the argument that it ""destroys"" your immune system, HOW is it delayed? is their nanotech in the vaccines that delays WHEN your immune system eats itself? or is it random? like what specifically is the argument? do you lose 30% of your immunity after 1 year? or is 40%, if you get a form of aids, you would think many ppl would know about it."	1

"Requesting the nurse to show vaccine vial. I have a 6-month-old son who was due for his shots. I asked the physician if the nurse could draw the vaccine in the office so I could confirm that the correct vaccine was given, along with checking the expiration date. The physician took it personally and told me that if I didn’t trust the office, then I should not be their patient. The nurse, on the other hand, didn’t have any problems with this request and showed me the vial. The reason I initially asked the doctor and not the nurse was because I would not see the nurse until she was ready to administer shots. 

I am an RN, but I left nursing a while ago. I was working on the ICU floor, but I would occasionally float to pediatrics, and there were times when parents requested that I show them what medications were administered or verify insulin dosage. I never had an issue with them and always complied with the request, understanding that there is a human factor and that errors, unfortunately, happen to the best of us. Doctor’s reaction made me very sad. I liked the doctor and didn’t want to disrespect him. I just wanted to confirm that the correct vaccine was given for my peace of mind. I have been very sad for a few days now, because I offended him and also because we will now have to change practice. But if I didn’t verify I would feel very anxious that correct vaccine was given.

So sick off of the booster shot! I took the booster yesterday, December  the 21st. I feel absolutely terrible. The first vaccine was okay I felt like weak for half of the day.

Scared confused rare These first two were from six months ago. I tested positive for HPV high grade not 16 or 18 then I had the colonoscopy These were the biopsy results on the second picture. Doctor said come back in six months. I did and I have cleared all HPV per pap results but now have the rare atypical glandular cells. Does this sound like I have something going on more in my uterus? I’m very scared. I would like to add that on this pap with the glandular cells. I was still spotting on my period. I had clue cells present with a bacterial vaginosis and had sex a few days before. Am I just trying to make up excuses to why the glandular cells could have been misinterpreted and present. I’m in fear of the uterine biopsy. And also if pregnant, what could this mean for me? 	0
"Afraid my girlfriend (25F) will break up with me (28M) because of HPV. How do I proceed? Me and my girlfriend have been dating for about 5 months and things are amazing. We've done lots of fun things together and overall have had a very enjoyable relationship spending time with each other. For context, I've been in two previous long-term relationships and she's a virgin with no dating experience. When we first started dating and getting physical, she asked me to get an STD test, which I did, and all tests came back negative. I never thought I had any STDs so didn't think much of it.
  

  
I was somewhat promiscuous about a year or two ago but decided that I want to settle down and have a family, as I realized that's what life should be about. I was always looking for a relationship but, during the time that I didn't find anyone to settle down with, I decided to indulge in what society tells us is normal and even encouraged as a 20-something.
  

  
Well, I just started seeing a few tiny spots on my penis and went to a dermatologist to get it checked out. They said it's HPV and gave me some Aldara cream to put on it to make them go away. They also said that this is a very low-risk strain of HPV, meaning even if my girlfriend contracts it, there's no real health risk other then these small spots that don't normally hurt or itch. The reason it's just showing up now is because it can take up to 2 years for symptoms to appear (I have not been unfaithful).
  

  
I have to tell me girlfriend this news and I'm afraid she won't take the news very well, and potentially break up with me. She is very conscious of her sexual health which is why she asked me to get tested initially. We haven't had oral or PIV sex yet so she's not at risk of anything, but I'm still very worried that she'll break up with me. How do I proceed and how do I go about telling her this news? We are crazy about each other and she's given me a few gifts that shows she's invested in this relationship for the long-run, but this could definitely be a speed bump.
  

  
TLDR: I found out I have HPV and I'm afraid my girlfriend will break up with me.

"Got a Hepatitis B vaccine I didn't need, any reason to get the second dose? Hey guys.

So I got a hepatitis B vaccination back in April. Afterwards, I realized I had already gotten three hepatitis B vaccinations around 1999 -2000 (early teenage years).

My upcoming second vaccination (6 months after my April vaccination this year) is scheduled for this week. It would be unnecessary to get this vaccination right? 

I've also got a plane to catch on the 13th ( for if the vaccine has any possible side effects or anything...?)

  
Thanks!"	0
? About Getting Vaccine After I Turn 18 Hopefully this is the right place, but I got my Pfizer vaccine at the age of 17 in May. I'm turning 18 this Saturday. Right now in Ontario, Canada there seems to be more Moderna than Pfizer and they are reserving the Pfizer more for the 12 to 17 age group. Question is, do I qualify in the 12 to 17 age group (Pfizer) or do I qualify in the 18+ group (Moderna) when I get my second dose? I am going back for a 5th year if that helps.	0
"Getting a rabies vaccine in the UK Hello, I hope someone can give me advice...

I have to get the rabies vaccine as it's required for my job. I'm phoning a travel vaccine clinic to arrange the first dose tomorrow. Would it be weird to ask questions about the specific vaccine they offer? Are there different types of rabies vaccines available in the UK? For reasons I won't go into, I do not want an mRNA vaccine and I've read that there are mRNA rabies vaccines. I'm a bit nervous about asking the person over the phone because I need to get it but I want to know more about the specific vaccine they use and potential side effects.

Thank you for any help."	0
"Stories about cervical cancer testing Hi,

I am a cytologist and part of my job is to examine Pap tests to detect cervical cancer and pre cancer. 

I lurk this sub to remind myself of the gravity of this duty; I am sorry to anyone that has to deal with this disease and hope you all do well.

I think about cervical cancer screening guidelines often and I am looking for perspective from people that are affected by this disease. Please do not participate if you think it may upset you.

I am looking for testing stories from cervical cancer patients:

Ie

- what kind of cervical cancer were you diagnosed with 

- any abnormal pap/ hpv positive history , type of hpv if available 

- what age you started pap/hpv screening

-hpv negative cervical cancers/ false negative Pap tests

- age when cervical cancer was detected and how

- any other details you find relevant to your cervical cancer screening

-colposcopy/biopsy stories

Thanks and good luck."	0
"RULES TO HAVE SAFE SEX AND PREVENT STDS… READ SO YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO I have done soooooo many research because I have health anxiety and I want to pass my knowledge to you all to prevent all your concerns..

1. If you want to have sex with strangers, ALWAYS ask if they are clean.. ALWAYS.. don’t just jump into it.. and USE A CONDOM.. WHETHER THATS BLOWJOB OR PENATRATION OR ANAL.. USE A CONDOM.

2. Condom only covers your penis to the base, your groin and balls can still get std like hsv, hpv. 

3. There is low chance of getting std from blowjob but to even get a lower chance you can use a condom

4. There a really really low chance of getting std from a HANDJOB

5. DONT LISTEN TO “ OH EVERYBODY HAVE HSV ITS FINE” DONT TAKE THE RISK CAUSE YOULL BE CRYING AND FREAKING OUT WHEN YOU DO GET IT

6. HSV can  be in the mouth or genital and anal. THERES A HIGH RISK in the anal , so always wrap up. 

7. Learn the difference between pimple and herpes and hpv

8. If you having symptoms just go to a doctor or urgent care… DONT GOOGLE CAUSE ANXIETY CAUSES SYMPTOMS AS WELL

9. MOST IMPORTANT FOR THE LADIES.. DO NOT LISTEN TO MEN WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE “CLEAN” ALWAYS INSIST ON CONDOM. MEN THINK WITH THEIR DICK AND NOT THEIR BRAIN, TRUST ME I AM A MAN.. USE A CONDOM TILL YOU ARE MARRIED. DONT HAVE SEX OR GIVE HEAD WHEN YOU ARE DRUNK."	0
"get hpv not covered by vaccine, no hope for future relationship  Got a wart and sent to biopsy. All negative for high risk. Doc says it’s a low risk subtype not covered by vaccine…. it really sucks

"""This is very encouraging data. Not only did most patients improve clinically with INO 3107 treatment, but..."" Nov. 13, 2024 ???????????? ""This is very encouraging data. Not only did most patients improve clinically with INO 3107 treatment, but the induction of a systemic inflammatory T-cell response and new T-cell clones that travel to the papilloma tissue to contribute to a cytotoxic response shows that it is possible to effectively address the immune dysregulation against HPV that is a hallmark of RRP.""

""These new immunology data are consistent with the clinical effect observed in our Phase 1/2 trial of elimination or reduction in the incidence of papilloma in the airway of RRP patients,"" said Dr. Matthew Morrow, INOVIO's Vice President of Translational Sciences. ""In a thorough immunological assessment, we observed that T cell infiltration in airway tissues of clinical responders was predominantly comprised of a T cell population detectable only after administration of INO-3107. This evidence supports the mechanism of action of INO-3107 and its ability to induce antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells targeting HPV-6 and HPV-11. Furthermore, this data adds to the body of evidence indicating that DNA medicines are an effective CD8 T cell generating platform.""

HPV question - unprotected sex So I recently slept with a guy who has HPV and a current wart on his penis. I am vaccinated against HPV had all 3 shots when I was about 12 I am 24 now. What is the risk that I could contact HPV since we had unprotected sex? I am having severe anxiety over this I don’t know what to do. I feel like it was a mistake and now I’m worried.	0
"HPV Vaccine-scared to get it I'm 27 and a virgin. Although I have received and performed oral sex.

Growing up my mother said no to the HPV vaccine because I wasn't active. But now that I am older I wonder if I should get it myself or not.

I still have fear of all the horrible stories I've read about it and side effects. Although that was more for the previous Gardasil, not the most current one.

My mom is a retired nurse and was brought up in the holiness religion so there's a lot to unpack there with all her beliefs and stuff. Also she and my dad were and still are a bit toxic to me in regards to certain things in my life (my relationships, my dreams). 

So I do not know what her current stance is on the vaccine and what she thinks about it MEDICALLY, but at least as far as because of sexual reasons, she didn't believe I should get it.

And I'm not going to ask because I don't want to go down that road -.-

Anyway I'm still scared to get it :("	0
"Approaching 2 years wart-free - my story Hi everyone, I've been taking a break from the forum for some time because I was wasting a bit too much time here - as much as I love helping everyone and find it therapeutic, I also needed to focus on other things! 

I wanted to make a post to mark the fact that I am approaching 2 years wart-free. Often people complain that nobody makes a happy post after they 'clear', so here I am offering some hope that **it gets better**. 

**Context:**

I was not vaccinated for HPV at school. It was introduced just after I left school and I was never told or recommended to get it as a 'catch-up'. 

I was in a very long relationship for many years. After the breakdown of my relationship, I started dating. I had an abnormal cervical smear (ASCUS) not long afterwards. This was very soon after the introduction of HPV testing as part of cervical screening in the UK, so I also had a positive high-risk HPV result. I went to colposcopy but they did not see any abnormalities so did not biopsy. In the UK, you will need to have an annual smear (as opposed to every 3 years) after a positive result - by the next year's test, my smear was normal and HPV negative. This continued for two more annual tests and my subsequent 3-yearly test earlier this year was also normal and negative. 

**How I was diagnosed with GW:**

I was dating someone for a while during 2019, and when this ended, I had two partners (who were aware of each other) at the start of 2020. **So I don't know exactly where the infection came from**. We had protected vaginal, oral and anal sex, and discussed sexual health and test results before having sex. One of these partners was a jerk so I stopped seeing him, and the other became my bofyriend. However, due to Covid, our relationship became long distance. 

In April of 2020, I was in the shower when I felt some strange bumps around my anus. As someone who suffers with health anxiety, I immediately freaked out and proceeded to have panic attacks pretty much every day for about a month. I told my boyfriend after a few weeks of freaking out. Because of Covid, it was really difficult to see a doctor, but I eventually managed to convince sexual health to let me come in (after screaming and crying down the phone to them). They confirmed that I had GW. 

I was really, really devastated by this and thought my life was over. I told my boyfriend that we couldn't be together anymore. He said he would support me through it, and booked to see his own doctor where he was living. His doctor told him that he shouldn't have sex with me for at least 4 months after the last wart removal. I had been given imiquimod, which said it took 16 weeks to work. So we were looking at maybe being able to have sex in the autumn. Given that we weren't even in the same place, it wasn't a huge issue. 

But I was really, really depressed and anxious about this diagnosis. So much shame, so much stigma, so many awful thoughts. I ended up seeking help from my doctor and began taking antidepressants. 

**Early treatment of GW:**

At first, imiquimod was fine and the few warts that were on the more 'normal' skin of my butt cheeks vanished pretty quickly. I was left with just a couple that were closer to the hole, i.e. on the more mucosal skin. However, the imiquimod started to get suuuuuuuper painful and itchy. I decided to wear it during the day instead of at night, and I needed to have a couple of breaks to let the skin heal. 

Eventually, I spoke to my doctor and got a second pack, because it hadn't succeeded in getting rid of everything. 

At this time, I stopped drinking. I was already exercising, never smoked, never took drugs, and ate a pretty healthy diet.

In the meantime, my boyfriend visited me, but we did not have sex by mutual choice. This was very difficult for me to handle. A few weeks later, he broke up with me. So now I was even more depressed, wondering if I would ever be able to date again. 

I set up getting the Gardasil vaccination in the hopes that it would help me. I took the three doses from October to April of 2020-2021 (iirc).

In late 2020, I saw a private doctor for cryotherapy. This doctor told me that I would have to find someone who really, really loved me enough to ever want to have sex with me. Obviously this was a very upsetting conversation! I had a few rounds of cryo with her until eventually the free clinic was again offering the service (which had been suspended during the main pandemic). The free clinic told me I didn't need to disclose anything to anyone and not to worry about it! At this time I decided that I would disclose and began to research more on HPV, including on this forum. I also did a lot of psychotherapy including EMDR.

**Ongoing treatment:**

As my one year anniversary came around, I was pretty sad about it. I had developed some new warts actually on my anus itself. I had been celibate for over a year. I really wanted to start dating again. I did start dating again in a slightly unconventional way, not involving penetrative sex at first, and of course with disclosure. Eventually, this changed as my partner's mindset shifted and I did have penetrative sex again. 

I had some other big health issues come up at this point, which was very difficult to deal with. I made a lot of changes to my diet and began to take lots more supplements. I added zinc sulfate because of its potential efficacy against GW.

I was still doing cryotherapy through 2021. Towards the end of the year I decided to combine cryo and imiquimod. I can't recall whether I got the imiquimod from the doctor or bought it online. I waited a few days after the cryo for the wound to heal and then applied the imiquimod. This worked well on my remaining warts, leaving me with just two very stubborn ones.

I started dating pretty seriously with the aim of finding a long-term relationship. In the course of this, I had a number of sexual partners, with disclosure. 

In 2022 I decided to try taking AHCC, despite my scepticism of the tiny trial numbers. My two warts remained. 

Finally, I decided to buy Inosine Pranobex from Amazon (not available in the UK on prescription). I don't want to advise buying drugs from the internet, because there is obviously a risk involved there. But I decided to take that risk. 

I did a couple of final rounds of cryo+ imiquimod, and finally, in October 2022, my last wart was gone. Overall, that was 2.5 years of visible warts.

**The situation now**

I have been wart-free for almost 2 years. 

I have a loving relationship. He doesn't care about HPV.

Helping people on here has helped ME immensely. Working through the research and understanding that HPV is nothing to be ashamed of, nothing we can avoid, and completely normal.

**Why did I have warts for so long?** I really don't know. HPV is a frustrating infection that can behave very differently in different people! I have read anecdotal comments from doctors that anal warts can be harder to get rid of (because the immune system in the area is wired to be quite chill given all the germs around there). I also had Covid in March of 2020 which may well have kickstarted the whole thing in the first place, so perhaps there were also problems in my body as well. 

**Did I make lifestyle changes?** As described above, I was already eating well and exercising and not smoking. I stopped drinking and have continued this since, especially given my other health problems. I took a lot of different supplements, mainly due to the other health problems. I personally don't think that lifestyle changes are necessarily a must when it comes to HPV, but it's also important to do the things that will make you feel better psychologically and will help you feel in control. 

**What worked in getting rid of the warts?** It's very hard to say exactly what did the trick, because I tried a lot! Was it finally the inosine pranobex? Maybe. But I can't really say to you that this is something you MUST do - there will be different factors in your body.

**Did the vaccine help?** Well, I got vaccinated a LONG time before my warts went. But maybe without it, I would have had more. Who knows! I'm glad I got it, because when dating again it gave me much more peace of mind. 

**Why did I date with GW?** I was celibate for a long time. After that I really felt like life was too short to be lonely and to potentially destroy my chances of having a family by putting off dating even longer. In the end it took me years to meet a loving boyfriend, so I'm glad I started when I did. I knew that dating with GW would be more challenging, and it was in a way. But it also meant that I was careful about whom I wanted to disclose to.

**How did I date?** I did a lot of dating, most of which didn't progress to kissing, let alone sex! For the few people that I did see for a while, either casually or with relationship intention, I found that the best course of action was to wait for a few dates (which I would do anyway) before bringing up the sexual health chat (which I would do anyway), either by text or in person. I've always been diligent about testing and discussing sexual health so it felt natural to do this. I did get a couple of rejections, either when I disclosed too early, or when the person was very anxious. However, I also got a lot of acceptance. Only one person decided to get vaccinated, which was actually after we started having sex. 

**What about after the warts were gone?** I continued disclosing to all my partners until a few months after GW were gone. At this point, I stopped disclosing to casual partners (of which there weren't many, given my focus on finding a relationship). I know this is a controversial choice on this forum, but I feel pretty confident in that choice given the research I've done and the viewpoints of experts. My partners were all sex-positive and highly sexually active people who have certainly had multiple strains of HPV in the past, and posed the same risk to me as I to them. I did continue to disclose for relationship dating because I have always wanted my relationship to be a space of safety and honesty, where I could discuss my worries, and in the unlikely event of any recurrence, it wouldn't be a shock. 

**Did my partners get HPV?** None of my partners, to my knowledge, developed visible warts (I'm still in touch with most of them and I think they would have told me) including some that I saw for a long time. Maybe they had my strain before, maybe they got it from me but never developed warts, maybe and probably they had their own types already. 

**Do I worry about recurrence?** Most of the time, no. I sometimes get overtaken by health anxiety but that's usually when something else is going on in my life to stress me out. That's when I start OCD physical checking. At the moment I have that under good control and I'm actually not going to psychotherapy for the first time in years!

**Do I feel dirty/tainted/different?** I used to. But I've done so much research and spoken to so many people on here that I think it's pretty impossible for me to feel that now. What did I do wrong? I had sex. Big deal. Sex is great and I love it and I've been blessed to have a lot of excellent, freaky, fun sex with some awesome people. It does come with some risks and we have to be able to deal with that. And besides, even those who are monogamous can and do get HPV. So I don't have any shame about my lifestyle, and furthermore, even if I hadn't chosen to date like a fairly normal adult human, I may have still got HPV anyway. 

**Is my boyfriend vaccinated and do we use condoms?** No and no, both by mutual agreement. I would probably prefer that he did get vaccinated but it's his body and his choice at the end of that day. 

**Am I a Big Pharma plant who is promoting the spread of HPV in a dastardly plot to make money for \[insert company here\]?** Babe, HPV don't need my help. "	1
Hysterectomy following LEEP For the past 5 plus years, I have had abnormal PAPs always coming back with high risk HPV. The latest colposcopy in August came back “normal” but with inflamed  cervix and the HPV. My dr wanted to do a LEEP to hopefully help clear the high risk HPV. The LEEP in October was done and apparently I had HSIL CIN3 hiding. They removed it and under it was chronic endocervicitis.  At my followup, my dr recommended I get a hysterectomy to remove all but one ovary.  She referred me to another Doctor since she doesn’t do them anymore. That doctor told me my insurance may not approve it since my margins were clear during the LEEP.  But she would try.  My mother passed away from stage 4 cervical cancer that spread to her bladder in 2018.  We are all extra careful because of that. I really hope my insurance doesn’t deny it. Has anyone experienced something similar?	0
"I got vaccinated for the first time in 17 years yesterday Okay. So my mom is a crazy ass antivaxxer and refused to vaccinate me for YEARS. I had my first and only vaccination for HIBS when I was 6 months old. She claims I had a “horrible reaction” due to the vaccine, and has refused to vaccinate me ever since. 
Yesterday, that all changed. Went to my annual checkup appointment (I am now 18 at this point) and asked if I could get vaccinated. The HIPAA laws protected me from my mother’s stupid antivax ways and I am now up to date on all of my shots :)

Don’t know if this is the right place to put this but I’m really proud of this story."	1
Vaccines You know why vaccines are bad	-1
"here is a crazy thought what if instead of telling anti-vax'ers that you wish their children would die, you acknowledge that like any medicine there is a small change that you can have an adverse reaction. the risk is extremely low but it can happen. 
The risk can be turned down to almost zero by having the vaccines separated rather than having them in 1 batch.  wouldn't that be a much stronger argument than all the hate comments I see here?
I know it's crazy but showing some understanding and discussing both sides of the argument without  the incredible amount of hate I see in these comments would be a nice change.

23F approx 105kg 6ft no acohol, vape 2mg nicotine-no smoking, currently taking prescribed propranolol to prevent headache, sumatriptan as acute treatment, sertraline & DepoProvera injection. based in UK

My story is quite long so please bear with me. On 8th June I received vaccine 1 of Pfizer, I sat up that night I received it and had this horrific pain in my head. I left it until the 48hrs recommended for symptoms had passed and then contacted GP, covid tested - negative and was referred to A&E with suspected bleed in the brain. I was admitted in to hospital and had 2x lumbar puncture (1 to check for bacteria possible meningitis, 2 for blood in spinal fluid) and a CT scan for the bleed. They all came back clear. The pain wouldn’t go away, it was on my left side usually but when I lay down on right side it would move with me. I was kept in hospital for 7 nights and treated with co-codamol only. I had severe photophobia and constantly had my eyes covered due to hospital lighting. I was discharged after they ruled out a bleed and meningitis and I visited a private neurologist who advised it could be stress. Now bearing in mind, I never suffer from headaches and this all started on the night of my vaccine. He advised it is stress and asked me to take time off work or demote myself, which I have done and also reduced my hours at work so I’m back to square 1 in my career. That was nearly 8 weeks ago and I am still getting severe head pains, photophobia (sometimes not as bad as it was in hospital) and now my headaches have started making me vomit and make my vision blurry with what look like black blobs round the outside of my vision. 4 months of constant head pain and I’m not getting any better, I’ve been prescribed anti-depressants because all of this has brought my mood down so so low and I was perfectly fine before I received the vaccine. I followed neurologist advice and received dose 2 about a month ago, there has been no change in my symptoms. Please is there anything I can try or another test they can do to see what is going on? I don’t believe this is stress and I feel like they don’t believe me when I say I have NEVER experienced anything like this before I received vax 1. Grateful for anything you can help me with"	0

"Can side effects from the flu vaccine start a day or so afterward? I got the most recent edition of flu vaccine in the evening on Monday (day before yesterday), and today I have a fever of 100.2F and possibly some stomach upset. I run at 97.something normally, so that's definitely a fever. I didn't feel great yesterday, but I have other chronic illnesses that could have been responsible. I don't think I felt feverish; there's a pretty noticeable ""my eyes/eyelids are warm when I close them"" sensation today that I didn't have yesterday.

Basically, I'm trying to figure out whether I have an actual contagious illness, or whether this could just be the semi-expected side effects of provoking one's immune system. I know that isn't really possible to tell from just this, I'll have to wait and see, but I thought I'd ask if it's reasonable this was the vaccine. "	0
"Are there limitations to vaccines? I am not anti-vaccine. Then again, I'm not pro-vaccine either. I guess you could say I'm agnostic. I am grateful for the advancements in medical technology that allow us to continually expand our life expectancy and reduce morbidity to increase quality of life - vaccines being one of those medical technologies.

However, I believe that the people that regularly visit this sub are probably in the best position to answer a question I've been thinking about....

Are there any limitations to vaccines? 

I'll expand. Let's just say that in the next 5 years, for one reason or another, the United States government is able to mandate that each person is required to submit to vaccination for all CDC-recommended vaccines that exist, including the yearly flu shot. Part one of my questions is - how many in this sub would support that?

Part two - within the next 10 years, new vaccines are created for 5 diseases.
* Ebola
* HIV
* Herpes
* The Common Cold
* Mononucleosis

The only catch is that each one of these new vaccines are literally brand new and since there is no way to ethically test vaccines and we have a mandated vaccine policy, we don't know if there are any potential side-effects. However, we do know one thing for sure:

One in one-hundred thousand people that received each of the vaccines above will die as a direct result of receiving it.

Which ones would you support being mandated? Which ones would you not?"	0
"Can I have sex? Getting It On with HPV **Disclaimers**

Before, we begin, if you're wondering about oral sex, please see my post here for more details on oral specifically: [https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/17v0ht8/can\_i\_have\_oral\_sex\_can\_i\_give\_oral\_sex\_your\_hpv/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/17v0ht8/can_i_have_oral_sex_can_i_give_oral_sex_your_hpv/)

This post will focus on **penis in vagina or penis in anus** sex. I know that is a slightly narrow definition of sex; I think my oral post will cover lots of scenarios for wlw. When it comes to vaginas rubbing on vaginas, I think a lot of the same principles as penis in vagina will apply. 

Addiitonally - for shorthand, I am referring to men and women in this post. Please understand that 'men' also encompasses 'people with penises' who may identify as other than men, and 'women' also encompasses 'people with cervixes' and/or 'people with vaginas' who may identify as other than women. I hope you will give me some grace here in not typing these out in full each time, and understand that I am referring to a very generalised and basic biology here for the sake of brevity and getting the point across. 

I am Not A Doctor. I have had both high and low risk HPV, the latter of which gave me GW for 2.5 years, and I am now 18 months wart free. I have researched extensively, and spent a lot of time on this forum helping people since my diagnosis. With that said, I am open to correction if you can cite your sources. 

On some points, HPV science is unclear or still developing, leaving us to make our own conclusions. My conclusions do not have to be your conclusions. 

So, with that said:

**Help! I've got HPV! Can I have sex?**

The short answer is...yes, of course you can have sex.

Let's consider this from a couple of different angles, based on posts we regularly see here on r/hpv.

**I've just got my smear results back and I've got a high risk cervical infection. I'm devastated. Can I have sex with my regular partner?**

Having a cervical infection at some point in your life is [pretty normal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6745688/). Although it can feel like a lot to process to hear that you have 'an STD', let's not forget that genital HPV is pretty hard to avoid, considering that [a large % of people](https://www.who.int/news/item/01-09-2023-one-in-three-men-worldwide-are-infected-with-genital-human-papillomavirus) have an active infection at any one time, condoms don't fully prevent transmission, most infections are asymptomatic, testing is not commonly done for men in most places (and where it is, it's usually not reliable), and only done for women every few years/on one tiny body part/usually only for a few strains. Additionally, it's possible for old infections to reactivate after time, so you can easily have a positive result after years of monogamy. 

So in this way, HPV is not like a lot of other STDs, like chlamydia or gonorrhoea, for example. It's something that we are very, very, very likely to have at some point in our lives and we can't do very much about that besides living in a polythene bubble, which personally doesn't sound like fun. 

If you have a regular partner (fuck buddy, boyfriend, submissive slave, wild love affair...) then there is a high chance that you already share the infection. They may have already given it to you. 

See this study that shows that [68% of heterosexual couples had anogenital HPV type concordance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1054139X1000025X) (i.e. they had the same type at the same time); another study showing [64-95% concordance](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/207/8/1286/889334) over short time spans - although this might just be DNA transfer and not necessarily established infection; [concordance of at least one HPV type in 57% of couples](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0040988https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0040988) \- and in those couples, 85% of the men had the same high risk type as the woman. 

(Interestingly, these studies also show that couples can have different strains independent of each other, which just goes to show...everyone you meet has their own strains and can give you a new type...yay). 

Anyway, this isn't about blame. It's usually not possible to know if they gave it to you, or you gave it to them (unless one of you came from a monastery, and even then, a small % of virgins are found to carry genital HPV). And it's actually not important. This is not an infection like chlamydia where we need to or can trace the chain of infection and then treat people. HPV is literally everywhere, and in most cases there is nothing we can do about it. And most infections pass without causing harm.

So, seeing as you very likely already share the infection with a regular partner, **there's no reason to stop having sex**. 

Of course, if you feel negative about sex then by all means take a break. But for purely biological reasons, there is no reason to stop. 

**Won't my boyfriend just reinfect me?**

With an infection like chlamydia, if you take your antibiotics but your boyfriend doesn't, then yes, when you have sex with your infected partner, you will just catch chlamydia again. 

HPV doesn't quite work like that. We have the viral infection in our bodies already, and it's active for some time. Think about it like you have a cold and your partner has a cold...when you kiss them, you're not catching the cold again. You've both already got it. 

Eventually, your body will suppress the infection is likely to produce antibodies so you're unlikely to 'recatch' the same type from your partner (if they haven't also suppressed their infection). 

There is a caveat here that [it seems to be harder for men's bodies to seroconvert](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4680989/#:~:text=Low%20seroconversion%20rates%20following%20HPV,HPV%20infections%20and%20subsequent%20disease) and get natural immunity. This can leave them open to more infections with the same type. If your strain is a vaccine strain then getting vaccinated could potentially support his body with this process. 

**Should we be using condoms?**

Given that you probably share your infection, isn't it a waste of time to use condoms?

No. Studies show that [using condoms helps promote the regression of cervical abnormalities](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6679446/). This is probably because it lowers the viral load being rubbed around so there's less for the body to deal with. 

Obviously, this is your personal choice and not a hard and fast rule, but it is something that's shown to help. 

**What about oral?**

See my post above. 

**I don't have a regular partner but I'm thinking about dating again. Having a high risk cervical infection makes me scared to date.** 

First off - everything I wrote above still applies. [Having HPV is extremely normal](https://www.hpvworld.com/articles/the-frequency-of-hpv-infection-worldwide/). For this reason, it's absolutely not a reason not to date. If you are on the younger side, a LOT of people you meet will already have their own HPV infection - but they might not know now, or ever know. 

See: [https://metro.co.uk/2022/10/02/asking-for-a-friend-can-i-have-sex-if-i-have-hpv-17479148/](https://metro.co.uk/2022/10/02/asking-for-a-friend-can-i-have-sex-if-i-have-hpv-17479148/) 

 *Essentially, Karen continues: ‘The only way to not get HPV or pass on HPV is to refrain from any type of sexual contact, which isn’t realistic for most people,’ which is why an* [***estimated 80%***](https://metro.co.uk/2022/09/26/everything-you-need-to-know-about-human-papillomavirus-hpv-17290349/) *of us are likely to get it in our lifetimes.* 

*So, is it considered safe to have sex if you have HPV? In short, yes.* 

*‘Our immune system is designed to get rid of HPV, like it does with colds, for example,’ explains Karen*

**Do I need to disclose my high risk infection to new partners before we have sex?**

Many doctors say you do not need to disclose. Why? Your partner will probably never know, and it's not likely to cause them harm. See [Jo's Trust](https://www.jostrust.org.uk/professionals/hpv/patient-questions) and the [British Medical Journal](https://blogs.bmj.com/bmjsrh/2020/01/14/partner-hpv/#:~:text=Unlike%20other%20STIs%2C%20there%20is,needs%20and%20concerns%20around%20disclosure) as two sources that support this view. 

However, on this Reddit, we lean towards disclosure. Why? We see the fallout when things go wrong, for one. And secondly, I personally think it's good to be honest with people and it encourages honesty from them (like are they getting tested for the testable things? Do they have oral herpes? Are they shagging anyone else right now? etc.). 

But, **once you test negative**, there is no need to disclose, unless you want to be able to discuss it on a relationship level. 

**TL;DR high risk cervical infection**: yes, you can have sex. You should probably tell your partner. You should probably use condoms. You should probably both get vaccinated. It's very normal.

**Okay, but I have genital warts.**

This is a bit more of a nuanced situation. 

Most medical advice is not to have sex with visible warts. Why? Warts are very contagious so it's easy to pass on the HPV virus to your partner, especially when there are the warts on the skin. 

If you have **a regular partner**, however, the above regarding shared infection still holds true. They may well share your infection already (unless vaccinated against your type). They may or may not ever develop visible warts themselves. 

So, in this situation, it needs to be a discussion between you. Perhaps you are happy to continue your regular sex life in the knowledge that you probably already have that infection (or you're vaccinated against it). Perhaps you decide to wait until you have removed your warts and gone for a few months without regrowths, in order to ensure the lowest viral load possible. Perhaps you decide to wait until one or both parties are fully vaccinated.

Certainly, [using condoms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2361997/) seems to make the duration of warts shorter. You might also want to factor in that wart treatment can be painful, and sex might be sore; some wart treatment like Aldara doesn't play nicely with condoms; and traumatising the skin can give rise to more warts while your infection is active (which is why you shouldn't shave while you have warts). 

If you have a **new partner**, you should definitely let them know that you have visible warts, and make that decision together. Again, perhaps you decide to wait until both parties are vaccinated; perhaps you decide to wait until a few months post your last wart; or perhaps you decide to go for it. 

On a personal level, I did have sex with visible warts. Why? My warts hung around for 2.5 years. I was celibate for 14 months of this time, which believe me was enough. I didn't want to waste my last fertile years (which actually had already gone, unbeknownst to me, but anyway) and I didn't want to be lonely and miserable. So, I started dating again, and disclosed to people once I got to know them. It was their choice to have sex, and to my knowledge none of them developed visible warts (although they may of course have the virus asymptomatically - or indeed have other strains not connected to me!). 

**What about when my warts are gone?** When you remove warts, your infection can still be active. Annoyingly, we don't currently have a way to know when it stops being active. There are different schools of thought on this, but you can reasonably assume that once your warts stop growing back, and you've gone a few months without them, you've probably immune suppressed. 90% of infections are suppressed within two years but the median is much lower (loads of studies on this but here's one on men, for example: [https://karger.com/acy/article/63/2/109/10152/Human-Papillomavirus-and-Genital-Disease-in-Men](https://karger.com/acy/article/63/2/109/10152/Human-Papillomavirus-and-Genital-Disease-in-Men)).

We actually don't know the details of HPV transmission after immune suppression, but it's likely to be much lower or even zero (logically, when we think about an inactive or undetectable infection). Given that seroprevalence in the population shows that a decent chunk of people have had wart strains (e.g. around 20% seroprevalence for HPV 6 in Germany: [https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-022-07028-8#:\~:text=HPV%2D6%20was%20the%20only,boys%20(p%20%3C%200.001)](https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-022-07028-8#:~:text=HPV%2D6%20was%20the%20only,boys%20(p%20%3C%200.001)), not even taking into account all the other strains that can cause warts) then there are a lot of past infections out there. You are now a pretty normal human being who has a past HPV infection. 

Whether you want to disclose this or not is up to you and how you feel about your relationship and discussing this kind of thing. 

**I'm never having sex again because I can't be responsible for giving someone cancer or warts, and I need HPV to stop with me.** 

If you are not comfortable dating or having sex, that is fine. If you never date again and you're happy like this, cool. If you want to date again but you need time to heal and have therapy, that's a good idea. Dating can be hard with or without HPV and you need a thick skin and a lot of self love. 

However. 

You having HPV does not **cause** cancer for other people. If someone is sexually active then they WILL come across HPV in their lifetime, from you or from anyone else they interact with. And in most cases that infection will just pass. If someone gets cancer many years or decades down the line THAT IS NOT YOUR FAULT - it is a quirk of their immune system that absolutely sucks, but, like - you did not directly cause that.

I could kiss someone tomorrow and get Covid and then get long Covid and not get out of bed for the next 10 years. Is that their fault?

My aunt could have kissed me on the cheek in 1997 and given me HSV1 which develops into Alzheimers in 20 years time. Is that their fault?

I could lick someone's butthole tomorrow and get H Pylori that develops into a stomach ulcer and I have to go to hospital. Is that their fault?

Etc. Etc. Etc. 

One could say, well, Spanakopita, you are going around kissing people so you are part of this big chain of bugs and diseases and infections!!! To which I say - personally, I cannot live in a bubble. I like kissing people. I like fucking people. I like falling in love and I want to be in a relationship which in my culture means I need to go on some dates and probably breathe on someone at some point. And yes, rub mucosal membranes.

I used to take a huge burden on myself, but when I started dating again, I realised that people I date take risks ALL the time, some of them highly stupid (hands up if you've been stealthed...yeah, me too). Most of the time, even though I know I have had HPV, I am WAY down on the list of risks those people take.  

HPV is like grains of sand on a beach. We are not going to eradicate it. We are vastly reducing the risks of cancer from HPV through vaccination (woohoo) but we cannot at this point in time remove the 30+ types not covered by vaccination from the population. So me not having sex really wouldn't make any difference to the situation.

What is more important to me these days is the risk \*I\* take. I do take the risk of having sex, because it's important to me, personally. I lower that risk by getting to know people and making sure that a) they are cool and b) the sex is gonna be fire, getting tested regularly for the testable stuff and asking partners for tests, having a frank sexual health chat before we get to it, and using condoms with new partners to protect myself against the big hitters. Also, I'm vaccinated with Gardasil and get my smears and a dental check done regularly. None of that negates the risks of sex, but it does mean that I've done my due diligence. I know that I might get a new strain of HPV from a new partner. But would I want that new partner to never leave their house again because they carry a very common virus? Hell no...

[https://www.medhelp.org/posts/STDs/Handsfield-6-month-disclosure-guidelines/show/552283](https://www.medhelp.org/posts/STDs/Handsfield-6-month-disclosure-guidelines/show/552283) 

I quote this post all the time so let's end on this.

"I had measles and chicken pox as a baby. I don't like all the conflict I see. I am not pro or against vaccines. I had measles and chicken pox one after the other when I was a baby under one year old (I'm sure my mother had a tough time).

What I understand is that you are scared of diseases. They are scared of autism (or something, i'm not sure). They are probably scared of  diseases too, but more scared of autism than diseases. I can understand being more scared of something else other than diseases, because having survived as a baby, the diseases are not scary to me. I'm immune to them by building anti-bodies against the virus itself, not a weak version of it. So I know I can survive against diseases.

You are trying to make other people understand by making fun of their fear. Their fear is irrational and making fun of it doesn't seem to turn it around. If making fun of others won't change how they think, I'd ask to be reconsidered if there's a good benefit of post that ridicules people that are anti-vaccines.

"I am concerned about he current state of our sub. When did we stop caring about the truth and become pro-vax just for the reason of being pro-vax instead of scientific evidence? Dear people of r/vaxhappened.

When I joined here there were a bunch of people who cared about the truth and concerned people sharing the shameful misinformation posted by the antivax groups of the internet. We were not ""pro-vax"" we were just right, fair and accurate and when we were not we called each-other out on it. 

Today I noticed that the sub does not seem to care about the truth anymore, anyone who even looks like they question if a vaccine or do not agree with pro-vax propaganda gets downvoted. No matter if they are right or they have the (real)science to back it up.
We have just become an angry mob that will violently crush anything that is not conform with the perceived ""truth"" that was created. It is just as bad as the people we ridicule. This is not a sub I want to be a part of, if this is a permanent change that means I will be leaving here and I hope that the falsehoods spread will not empower the antivax movement even more. 

We should never define ourselves as just pro-vax. One's stance should originate from the current science and the goal to provide everyone with the safest possible world. From the outside this will mostly be what can be seen as ""pro-vax"" but at its core it is completely different. The right choice for the wrong reason can still be wrong. We should never dismiss facts or science because it doesn't fit ""the narrative"" the science and facts should be the core of what we stand for. Sure there is science that is wrong or faulty, in those cases we should dismiss it for being wrong or faulty, not for the results they found. We should never become an echo chamber trying to drown out the voices that do not share our opinion.

We need to be above that and be a voice of reason. Not debate around with artificial ""facts"" and scary stories and be just another polarized group without any real merit. We should try to educate people instead of drowning them out. We should learn about the mistakes made by the antivax not copy them. 

My apologies for the rant, I really needed to get this off my chest. Feel free to discuss anything I said here or add to it. Contrary to vaccine safety and disease mortality there are not many facts here and it is an almost pure block of opinion.

Edit, dammit I messed up the title."	0
"Eighteen foundational falsehoods of vaccine safety and effectiveness, presented by the CDC themselves! So this is a long read, but it's very important to read, if you want to know what CDC really is. 

I, an 18 year old, was looking into the CDCs statistics, to find out data about how many people died, get, and now die, from measles, and the complications it causes, and I was flabbergasted at what I was reading... False information, manipulated, sneaky, contradictory, and outright INSANE and inaccurate data. 

Here's what I discovered: 

[https://www.cdc.gov/measles/downloads/MeaslesDataAndStatsSlideSet.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/downloads/MeaslesDataAndStatsSlideSet.pdf)

&#x200B;

First inaccuracy:

''Great progress has been made towards measles elimination''

Well not really, firstly, measles can do more damage to vaccinated people because there immune systems are weaker than naturally immune people who have already had measles, either when they were a baby, or a kid, when there immune system is strong, or assisted by breast milk. Vaccinated people take longer to recover from measles, (and yes 10% (admitted by CDC) of vaccinated children are not protected at all, (and yet you blame unvaccinated kids for spreading diseases, 10% of vaccinated people may as well be considered unvaccinated)), and since vaccines are put into the bloodstream, when measles comes through a natural method, such as through the gut, or lungs, the body will not only have the measles for the second time, (since the vaccine already gave them essentially measles) meaning they could have standard measles on top of vaccine strain measles, but will also have possible vaccine induced immunocompromisation, which would result in a less efficient fighting off of the disease.

&#x200B;

Secondly, by ''Great'' I suppose they would be suggesting that overall, the vaccine program was a success, but if they have not done any placebo, or control studies, to show vaccines are overall benefiting, and are not dangerous and doing more harm than good, then to say this, is an unsubstantiated claim.

Those in scientific and medical fields frequently demand well-designed studies, like double-blinded, randomized,  placebo-controlled trials, so why not apply that same requirement to vaccines? Why hasn’t anybody ever done that study, except small independently funded ones that have little access to resources and data. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Second inaccuracy:

''From 2000-2016\*:•Reported measles incidence decreased 87%, from 145 to 19 cases per million persons

•Annual estimated measles deaths decreased 84% (20.4 million deaths prevented)''

&#x200B;

So, if we take the average between 145 - 19, maybe 80.. So, take 100 for easy maths and an estimation, there's around 7000\* bigger for 7 billion people, so lets time 100 by 7000, we get 700,000, meaning 700,000 cases of measles, I'm going to guess, over a period of a month? So lets times that by 12, that's 8,300,000 cases per year.. (That kind of sounds too much but I'll stick with it) that's 8.3 mil x 16 years, so 132 million cases in 16 years, we'll knock that down to 100million because of overestimation.

&#x200B;

So, lets say that without the vaccine, that number would be 87% higher, meaning 187million cases would have occurred.

&#x200B;

So they claim that 20.4million out of 187million cases would have resulted in death. That's a rate of 1/9 cases = death.

&#x200B;

The CDC literally admitted, that in 1950s, before vaccines were introduced, measles caused death in 1/1000 cases.

Yet incredibly, and astoundingly, they claim in 2000-2016 that 1/9 cases would have caused death, without the vaccine?

That's a 100x exaggeration for 1950s, so fuck knows what that is for 2000s and 2010s...

This is insanity, people are buying into the CDC, making 150x exaggerated claims!

It's purely asinine! It's fucking scary.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Third inaccuracy:

The graph on page 3. 

So this graph says that 20.4million deaths were prevented by vaccines. So, I counted the number of deaths over 16 years, which was around 4-4.5 million, and the number of deaths, they presumably expected had the vaccine not been used, so 550,000 per year for 16 years which = 9million, now lets do the MATH, that's 5 million deaths prevented at BEST. Not 20.4 million.

&#x200B;

 Now, on TOP of this, how the hell, did they determine what the number of deaths per year would have been had the vaccine not been used? Did they do a placebo test? Did they look at an alternate universe where it was not used?

It's absolutely impossible to determine how many of those deaths reduced due to vaccines, and how many would have been reduced anyway. 

And on top of THAT, measles deaths were decreasing on trend, significantly, way way before the MMR was introduced, and had been for many dozens if not hundreds of years.

&#x200B;

This is absolutely shocking, complete data falsification, made up facts, and all it takes is 10 minutes of reading to figure out the lies. They don't expect people who are skeptical and critical to come along and read it though. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Fourth inaccuracy:

''U.S. Measles Burden: Before 1963 Vaccine Development\* 

Each year, measles caused an estimated 3 to 4 million cases

Close to 500,000 cases were reported annually to CDC, resulting in:

48,000 hospitalizations

1,000 cases with encephalitis (brain swelling)

450 to 500 deaths''

&#x200B;

So, here they start off by saying, measles caused 3-4million cases, in the US, before vaccines.

Then the next line says, 500,000 cases were reported annually, (which I admit could be because not all were reported, but they didn't consider this when looking at the symptoms).

&#x200B;

So, the 48,000 hospitalizations, how did they determine that these weren't out of the whole country? Not just the 500,000 reported? This could be 48,000/3,000,000 not 48,000/500,000.

Also, hospitalizations were not necessarily bad, sometimes it was just people being forced to get vaccinated, or treated, because it was thought necessary, or encouraged, for unreasonable reasons. 

&#x200B;

Then, 1,000 cases of encephalitis (again 1000/500,000 or 3-4million? Hmm I wonder), which ironically, is potentially the result of vaccine injury, and since vaccines can sometimes give you measles anyway, and vaccine injury can sometimes be diagnosed (with bias) as measles injury, as the symptoms can often crossover, it wouldn't be unreasonable to think that many of these cases were vaccine related anyhow. And since they inject aluminum into your blood, which can absorb into your lymphatic system, which takes white blood cells (which could be carrying aluminum) to the swollen parts of the brain, then as the brain lets in the blood cells, bypassing the blood brain barrier, and we know aluminum can cause many brain problems, which have been tested in rats, and found in human brains after death, in people who were autistic, brain damaged, paralyzed and other things.. then we know that it's reasonable to at least require some extensive study into this, to find out for certain what problems this could be causing, and what could be causing these problems.

&#x200B;

Now here's where it gets even more mind boggling:

It says 400-500 deaths per 500,000 or 4million (it doesn't state) but either way, it's either 1/1000 cases = death, or 1/8000 cases = death. IN 1950-60s!

So, on page 7, they say that in current time, 1-2/1000 cases result in death. The problem here is, that's in 2016, and if that's 2016, why is 1950-1960 less likely to die from measles than today? Did measles become more deadly, are vaccines making measles more deadly like I mentioned earlier? Or, the only other possibility is, that, this data, is entirely MADE UP.

&#x200B;

Lets look at the facts, in the past 10 years, in the US, maybe a couple thousand cases of measles have occured.. Okay, so that must mean that 2 have died, well, only 1 has, so that 1-2 is just exaggeration, and also,  if 1 person has died from measles out of 2000 cases, how could you possibly determine the average death rate from ONE example to go by?

&#x200B;

If in 1950 the death rate was 1/1000-1/8000 so, say 1/5,000, and that was with data of 400-500 deaths per year, then who in their right mind would think that having 1 example to go on, is enough information to claim that measles kills more people today by rate, than it did in 1950? Is that evidence that vaccines made measles more deadly? Or that they're making shit up? I think the latter.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Fifth inaccuracy:

''Measles was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000 thanks to a highly effective vaccination program and other control measures. ''

&#x200B;

Measles was never eradicated, it was made out to be, but never was, it was present in 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003, and those were the lowest years in the past 20, and who knows if this was just arbitrary, or whether the vaccine really was the reason.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Sixth inaccuracy:

''However, measles remains present in many other countries and can be brought into the United States by unvaccinated travelers (Americans or foreign visitors). 

•This can result in outbreaks that are costly to control.''

&#x200B;

Firstly, they admit themselves, that vaccinated people can be unprotected, at the rate of 1/10, and it is proven that vaccines don't eliminate infection, only development. Vaccinated people are admittedly contagious, and you could argue that since vaccinated people don't know they are, and aren't generally seen as so, as it's not common knowledge that vaccinated people are contagious too, then this means vaccinated people are a greater risk to spreading disease to vulnerable people, because unvaccinated people who are infected, have symptoms, and know they are ill, they (now days) stay away from others, and therefore are not likely to spread diseases. 

&#x200B;

Hospital signs in cancer wards and the like, say ''If you were vaccinated within 30 days, stay out of this ward'' and I wonder why this is? Is vaccine shedding really a myth? Or is a fabricated myth that in reality is so true hospitals literally put signs up saying it is.

&#x200B;

Outbreaks are also not that costly to control, but are costly to report, and spread propaganda on, and often are forcefully  made costly as means to make out measles is as bad as they possibly can make it out to be, if they can add cost to it, then they can claim it costs the government money, but it doesn't need to. That's the point, it's not necessary for it to cost money, it can cost virtually nothing and no problems will further arise.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Seventh inaccuracy: 

''Measles elimination is a global problem.''

A greater problem however, is malaria, and this is not nearly as talked about, and reported on. The U.S has more cases of malaria, than measles, yet measles is reported on and talked about 50 times more than malaria. 

&#x200B;

Measles is a problem, but it's a mild problem, not very serious, and is not problematic enough to rush a vaccine program without safety testing, to rush vaccines down peoples throats as fast as possible over, and to not think about whether putting measles into people, unnaturally, is a good way to stop measles from getting into people, naturally.. And not just a great way of introducing unnecessary health problems, death, and serious injuries, in preference for money, feeling of human accomplishment, sense of security and comfort, all by wishful thinking, appeals to peoples emotions, and fear tactics.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Eighth inaccuracy: 

''Encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) 1 per 1,000 cases''

&#x200B;

Wait so you mean to tell me that encephalitis from measles rose from 1000/3,000,000-4,000,000 cases to 1000/1,000,000 cases between 1950-60 and 2016?

&#x200B;

Hmm lets see, what could possibly cause a rise in encephalitis? Well, how about that thingy that has toxic chemicals that are put into the lymphatic system? Oh wait, I don't need to say this, it already says it on the vaccine INSERT. 

&#x200B;

The pharmaceutical companies already admit countless side effects and injuries ranging from death to seizures, comas, allergic reactions, meningitis, encephalitis, allergy developments, asthma, atopic eczema, allergic rhinitis, disabling asthma, immunocompromised disorders, and so many other things I couldn't fit here. Who knows what they're not admitting.

This is the same companies that had to remove their mmr 1 vaccine because it was causing meningitis, and vioxx because it was causing heart attacks and disease. When will they remove the next one, and what reason? 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ninth inaccuracy:

''As many as one out of every 20 children with measles gets pneumonia, the most common cause of death from measles in young children.''

&#x200B;

In that case then, why, in 1960, was pneumonia the cause of 30/100,000 deaths in the US? And in 1998, it was the cause of 30/100,000 deaths in the US, in ALL AGE groups.

&#x200B;

No change, but after 3-4 decades of vaccine usage, the supposed 1/20 cases of pneumonia in kids should have in turn resulted in a decrease of pneumonia cases significantly.

Let's look at the cases in children under 12, [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200005113421904](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200005113421904).

They had been going down steadily for a long time before vaccines were introduced, and the vaccine introduction seemed to have NO effect whatsoever. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Tenth inaccuracy: Labelled severe complications:

''•About one child out of every 1,000 who get measles will develop encephalitis (swelling of the brain) that can lead to convulsions and can leave the child deaf or with intellectual disability.

•For every 1,000 children who get measles, one or two will die from it''

&#x200B;

Now again, how did they determine that the encephalitis was caused by the measles, and not a result of another vaccine, or the very vaccine used to 'prevent' measles? If the children weren't at all vaccinated, then, again, I'd like to know why on earth was the rate of encephalitis from measles before the vaccine introduction was 1000/3-4million and is now 1000/1,000,000.. Also, if measles is soo uncommon now, at a few thousand cases over 20 years, then how did they determine that 1/1000 got encephalitis? There's barely any data to look at..

&#x200B;

Again I've already addressed the second bullet point, it's an unsubstantiated, unfounded, and demonstrably evidently false claim.

In the 50s and 60s, 500/3-4million died, and yet suddenly, now days, with the betterment of health, hygiene, diet (generally), education, technology, treatment, medical knowledge on preventing death, and other factors, that the death rate is suddenly higher? And again, 1-2, yet the only data suggests only 1. Pure exaggeration and fear mongering.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Eleventh inaccuracy:

•Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a very rare, but fatal disease of the central nervous system that results from a measles virus infection acquired earlier in life. SSPE generally develops 7 to 10 years after a person has measles, even though the person seems to have fully recovered from the illness. Since measles was eliminated in 2000, SSPE is rarely reported in the United States.

•Among people who contracted measles during the resurgence in the United States in 1989 to 1991, 4 to 11 out of every 100,000 were estimated to be at risk for developing SSPE. The risk of developing SSPE may be higher for a person who gets measles before they are two years of age. 

&#x200B;

Again, how do we know that this is exclusively caused by wild measles? Is it even possible that injecting almost wild measles, into your bloodstream, which is closely linked to your nervous system, could be, without even having the measles fully blown and spread across the body, causing SSPE as well?

It's just not enough to say that vaccines prevent these things, without demonstrating that vaccines don't also cause these things, and finding out how often it does, if so.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Twelfth inaccuracy: 

Page 9) These measles cases, are not just measles that unvaccinated people have gotten, but, for example in the rockland county 'outbreak' 1/3 of the people who got the measles, were vaccinated.  


&#x200B;

Thirteenth inaccuracy:

Page 12) 40,000 + 30,000 + 10,000 + 57,000 + 5,000 + 142,000 (\*per person, worked out roughly) =   

284 ÷ 6 = 47.3333333333. 

What on earth could possibly cost 50 grand per person, when you get measles?

&#x200B;

If this is true, then in 1950s, people must have spent the equivalent of 200,000,000,000 + increase due to the less availability of medical care, expenses of there being less doctors and nurses, and less knowledge on how to treat the diseases.

So we're talking maybe 300 billion dollars a year? Are you out of your mind CDC? 300 billion dollars were spent per year in the 50s just for measles cases? 

&#x200B;

Bull shit if you ask me. I'd say possibly a 10 - 150 million per year, were spent, not 300 fucking billion.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Fourteenth inaccuracy:

''Measles is due to failure to vaccinate. Case investigations are very resource-intensive.''  

No, you have not demonstrated measles is solely due to failure to vaccinate, it could be the failure of vaccines, the failure of making people aware that vaccine shedding is a REAL thing that REALLY causes measles to spread, and that full blown measles can be gotten by an MMR vaccine. 

&#x200B;

They also admit here, that the reason it's expensive when outbreaks happen, is the investigations are resource-intensive, but that's not unvaccinated peoples fault, you don't have to spent tons of money to investigate measles and report on it, only if you want to spread lies, propaganda, and repair peoples filter bubbles so they can continue to think measles is awful, vaccines are safe, and well tested, and vaccines are GOOD and BENEFICIAL, when they are not tested, and don't even need to be. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Fifteenth inaccuracy:

''•Luckily we have safe and effective vaccines that can prevent much of this burden, and we should not lose sight of the many successes that have been achieved.

•Modeling estimated that, among children born during 1994–2013, vaccination will prevent an estimated 322 million illnesses, 21 million hospitalizations, and 732,000 deaths over the course of their lifetimes, at a net savings of $295 billion in direct costs and $1.38 trillion in total societal costs. 

•Additional successes include the fact that outbreaks since measles elimination have generally been limited (in both size & number of generations)''

&#x200B;

No, vaccines are not effective, and are admitted to be dangerous, admitted to cause shedding, admitted to cause measles, admitted to have literally hundreds of mild to severe side effects. 

&#x200B;

Measles is not a burden, it's a slight inconvenience, like a shitty cold. Measles is actually proven to be overall benefiting to health, this is UNDISPUTED in the medical sciences, measles lowers risk of heart disease, and some cancers, (don't quote me on this, but it has health benefits that are agreed upon by virtually all scientists in the field).

Measles, even in the first world war, was virtually harmless, only killed 1/800 people or so, and was already becoming naturally endangered, and by the 50s, and 60s, measles was something which families would get together and purposely give to their children, so that they would get it and be immune for life. 

This is PROVEN science, agreed upon by all non bias, scientists who don't have conflicts of interest.

&#x200B;

''vaccines will prevent.... 732,000 deaths over the course of their lifetimes,'' (1994 - 2013 born children).

We already know this is undetermined, made up propaganda. They don't know how many lives vaccines saved, they CAN'T know, they haven't done a placebo or any study with a control group, they also don't even consider that A. Deaths were plummeting, plenty of time before vaccines were even considered. B. That vaccines could EASILY be causing more deaths than it's saving, and this needs to be investigated, it's not fair to not show that vaccines are doing overall good to the health, and lives of people. It's evil.

&#x200B;

''•Additional successes include the fact that outbreaks since measles elimination have generally been limited (in both size & number of generations)''

Well this is just a tautology, yes, we know vaccines reduced cases of wild measles, you don't have to put it in such a strange manner.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Sixteenth inaccuracy: 

''Elimination has been achieved & maintained for 15 years''

Wait, but there's been 2000 cases in the past 15 years.. 

And elimination of a bomb, by blowing up the bomb, is not an achievement by any means. It's fighting a house fire, by transporting it to the neighbors and saying ''look we stopped your house from burning down!'' and yet, in this situation, we don't even know whether there's still fire in the kitchen, we only checked the bedroom.. No one has even walked in to check whether or not they stopped the fire, or whether or not the hose water is acid or just water. And when someone asks to check in the house, the firefighters say ''NO it's UNETHICAL TO GO IN THERE!''.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Seventeenth inaccuracy:

''The vaccine works and the disease is recognizable which makes eradication both possible & achievable.''

Not really true, measles has been so rare, that doctors have forgotten how to accurately and reliably identify measles, most of the doctors today weren't even doctors when measles was common.

&#x200B;

The vaccine doesn't 'work', it has - worked, and can, work, but it doesn't necessarily work full stop. We don't even know whether measles is evolving to be unaffected by vaccines, quicker than the vaccines can evolve. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Eighteenth inaccuracy:

Page 15) This is just an advertisement, CDC is selling you a product, not regulating products, the people who work for CDC, are sometimes have a conflict of interest, given to them or offered to them by pharmaceutical companies, and this is factually correct, if you look at the news, and see how many examples of this actually happening. The regulatory foundations are not really regulating, they're assisting in selling a product.

They finish off, claiming unfounded statements, that measles is spread by unvaccinated people, but this is factually incorrect, on many levels I have already talked about.

&#x200B;

Lastly, here's an analogy I think works for the pro vaxxer - anti vaxxer question, which is ''You're putting your child at risk, why?'' ''Why are you letting your kid die?'' ''You know your kids won't live long, you are a murderer!''

&#x200B;

Here it is: (It's hypothetical somewhat).

&#x200B;

There's person A (unvaccinated person), with a piece of string attached from their hand to their heart, which is 20CM long, and if removed, will have reasonable chance of killing them, if they break it. They also have 100$ in their hand.

&#x200B;

There's person B says, ''Give me the money in your hands! Or I'll stab you with this plastic knife!''.

&#x200B;

If person A dies from a stab wound, they did not kill themselves. Pro vaxxers would say they did."	-1
Vxrt on fire ?? Finally, they are having a chat from a Dr at Stanford to tell people about the various advantages we have from our pills in comparison to current vaccines. VXRT is getting started internationally ??????	0
"My husband won't get the COVID vaccine, SMH! Hey Reddit folkx. Buckle up, I got a lot to spill this afternoon.

I'm  a 30 year old female, and my husband is a 36 year old make. He is an  ex-smoker and is in semi-okay shape I guess. He works in film, and is  exposed to hundreds of people on film sets every day. He gets COVID  tested multiple times per week, and they're pretty careful on film sets,  but not everyone is vaccinated. Additionally, there were a few COVID  outbreaks on set last year around flu season, and the testing definitely  proved to be more of a stop-gap measure and tracing tool as opposed to  protection against the virus.

I am  fully vaccinated and vehemently pro-vaccination. I don't want to tell  other people what to do with their bodies, but my husband and I share a  home, and I am nervous.

At the  beginning of COVID, my housemates' father died from the disease. This  really hit home for me, as my 70 year old father recently recovered from  Prostate Cancer and his immune system is pretty messed up from the  treatments. On top of this, he has a blood disorder, and a pulmonary  issue (he was treated for 20 blood clots in his lungs recently as well).  As such, this pandemic has made me extremely anxious about the health  of my family. My parents basically lived up north in a remote cabin and  only Skyped us for an entire year. My family and I are extremely close.  Even when I was living abroad, they came to visit me several times. Not  seeing them for so long was painful.

With  the vaccine rolling out, we all felt extremely hopeful about the  possibility of getting together in person again. My sister, and both  parents are full vaccinated. We have slowly started meeting for dinners  and get togethers. It has been wonderful.

Unfortunately,  my parents as well as my entire extended family have set some firm  boundaries about vaccine status at family get togethers. Given the  health of my father, as well as the health of my elderly uncles and  young cousins (who aren't vaxxed yet as they're under 12), we are not  okay with getting together with anyone who is unvaccinated. My mom has  brought this up leading up to the holidays, and was in tears about the  fact that we can't include my husband unless he gets vaccinated. My  parents love my husband dearly, and we have only been married for 2  years. It breaks their hearts that the whole family cannot be together  over the holidays. My cousins and aunts have also raised their eyebrows  about him not being able to join us for Christmas get togethers, and  I've had to defend my husband to my family despite me not agreeing with  his decision AT all.

Additionally,  I have several friends who have expressed concern about the possibility  of me spreading the virus, given that I live with an unvaccinated  person who is exposed to other un-vaxxed people daily.

During  the previous winter, when COVID rates were super high where we live, he  wasn't that careful. He had an emotional affair in the winter, and he  lied to me about going over to this woman's house after Christmas when  both of us had seen our families and could therefore spread the virus.  Him and this woman shared joints, cigarettes, had a charcuterie board  together.. then he came back and exposed my entire household to whatever  she could have been carrying. Luckily, none of us got COVID, but he  didn't really recognize or acknowledge the fault in his faulty decision  making. I disclosed this to my close circle of friends, as it was  causing my great distress, and all of them grew even more weary about  being exposed to his sloppy antics through me (given that we live  together).

As such, and given the  fact that I can also spread the virus to my husband, I have had to live  isolated despite being fully vaccinated. I feel isolated from friends  and family, and it's driving me mad because I was one of the first  people in my friends group to get fully vaccinated and have been one of  the most careful people with COVID.

My  husband's entire extended family is super anti-vax, conspiracy theory,  Q-ANON, Right-wing idiots about this all. None of them are vaccinated,  even his older uncle who goes into the hospital on a weekly basis for  kidney dialysis treatments. There are so many young kids in his family  that  go to daycare, and kidney disease is genetic. His mother recently  contracted covid and proudly boasted being fine after. His family and  mother frequently compare getting vaccinated with being sent to gas  chambers, and liken how Governments are handling to pandemic to  Holocaust-era Nazi Germany. My Great Uncle is a survivor of Auschwitz  and my grandfather is a WW2 vet. Nothing disgusts me more than people  using the Holocaust as a talking point for COVID related issues. As  such, I have severed ties with several of his family members. I have  politely refused to get together with them throughout the course of the  pandemic. They have been getting together a lot, seeing friends, living  their lives as though there is no pandemic. This has really upset  several members of his family, including his mother, who is now in my  husband's ear about how I ""don't like her"", and how my husband should  just sneak around and see his family without telling me. He obviously  won't be doing this. I'd like to point out the fact that my  mother-in-law has been the cause of a lot of issues, and likely has a  personality disorder. She is abusive, and highly manipulative. She has  made our lives a living hell at times and my husband hasn't set firm  boundaries with her about this. She has been the cause of many, many  issues throughout our entire relationship. She has even been so bold as  to insult both of my parents at our wedding, which my parents planned  and paid for entirely without the help of his family.

His  extended family has criticized me for my decision to get fully  vaccinated, and claims that I am against freedom of speech and am  judgmental.

I'd also like to point  out how my family has been nothing but helpful and supportive to my  husband, despite his decision to not get vaccinated. The double standard  kills me.

Back in September, I  almost convinced him to get vaccinated. He agreed to do it, but never  did, and when we discussed it again, said he won't get it. I booked him  an appointment and he immediately made me cancel it.

His  reasoning for not wanting to get the vaccine have been: that he has a  heart condition- which I have never heard about. Apparently he has a  heart murmur? Which I believe would be even worse if he got COVID? I've  been with him for 7 years and this is the first I've heard of his heart  problem. I have been with him to several doctors appointments and it has  never come up until certain friends ask him about his vaccination  status. The other answer is that he had a prophetic dream, where higher  powers were warning him against getting vaccinated. Apparently, these  same higher powers told him about the pandemic before it happened, and  protected him from a COVID outbreak on one of his sets last winter. He  says he can't explain it, but that I need to trust him. Ridiculous,  right? He very passionately dis-aligns himself with being an  anti-vaxxer, he just claims that he is hesitant and waiting for a  non-MRNA vaccine. When I ask him about this in more detail, he can't  explain it. He has a grade 9 high school education tops (he dropped  out), and while I think he's smart, he is no medical doctor.

Anyways,  this has all been too much for me to handle. I do not want to live  isolated, and I feel extremely unsafe sharing a household with him. I  have sat him down several times to discuss the safety of the vaccine, as  have many people. I have informed him several, several times about how  his decision has made me feel unsafe in our home, has made me feel  isolated, and is generally causing a great deal of tension in our  relationship. He comes back with ""you don't think I feel upset too?"" and  then shoots back about how I could also be putting him in danger by  going out and living my life without regard for COVID transmission, even  though I'm vaccinated.

I have  told him to move out. I cannot handle this. He says he will get  vaccinated by Christmas, but I have not seen any effort to do so. We  have pop-up vaccine clinics EVERYWHERE in our city. He could get a first  dose on his work lunch breaks. No dice. I do not see any plan to get  the vaccine. He is also not making any moves to move out. I broke up  with him last week, and this week, we discussed couples therapy, but I  see NO work from him so far. He doesn't even bring up our breakup with  me. When I have candid conversations with him and clearly communicate  how I'm feeling, he sits there and says nothing.

There  have been several other things that have come up in our relationship, I  am just focusing on this. Please be gentle with me, but fuck...  What  do I do?"	1
Did vaccines make measles rarer, but more deadly? Seems like it. 1/8,000 death rate by 1960. 1-2/1000 death rate by 2016? What happened? Did people just become unable to survive measles 8x more?	-1
"Pro vaxxers just cannot understand that showing a vaccine reduces chance of death/hosp from COVID (not all causes/in absolute sense) doesn't show vaccines save lives period (assuming they can even do that) only that it has one specific mortality benefit. That is it. To show a vaccine actually increases your chance of surviving period, not surviving COVID, or illness and hospitalisation period, not just against covid19, you have to show an overall sum of the benefits and costs by comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated and their total outcome.

It's really telling that pro vaxxers rarely understand this. I just posted a question and like 7+ pro vaxxers already have linked studies saying vaccinated are at lower risk of death FROM COVID, which doesn't prove they are at lower risk of death ... Full stop... 

If those studies are even reliable."	-1
"High risk HPV to HPV free I did it y'all!

I’m 27 years old. In May 2019, I went to an appointment for my annual and received news that I had high risk CIN2. I was devastated. After the initial shock settled, I shifted my mindset and decided I'd use this as an opportunity to become healthier. I went back in November 2019 and my HPV regressed to CIN1. I went back last week for a follow up and my results are negative!

Breakdown of what I did:

 \-Changed my diet. Ate lots of fruits and veggies. Tried to buy organic when I could. Foods I ate pretty regularly were kale, spinach, avocados, bananas, blueberries, apples, sweet potatoes, almond butter, walnuts, lemons, almond milk, beets, bell peppers, zucchini, shiitake mushrooms, carrots, brussel sprouts, butternut squash, broccoli, and tomatoes. This past May I started eating salmon twice a week. I mostly gave up meat. I still ate dairy. I tried to stay away from sugar but I would occasionally indulge. 

\-Worked out 5-6 times a week (running, HIIT, or yoga)  
\-Drank green tea everyday (3 cups on average)  
\-Made a green smoothie almost everyday.\*  
\-Bought “Your Super” mixes. yoursuper.com Up until a month ago, I added ""Super Greens"" and ""Forever Beautiful"" to my smoothies. Added ""Mellow Yellow"" for a few months.  
\-In the past 3 months, I had Garden of Life turmeric gummies every morning.  
\-Up until Jan 2020, I drank a glass of water with 2 tbsps of apple cider vinegar on an empty stomach every morning.  
\-I went off birth control pills in July 2019. There's a lot of mixed research on the pill. My doctor insisted the pill does not cause HPV.  
\-Stopped using tampons and used pads instead.  
\-Haven't had alcohol since March 2020. Before then, I still drank with friends on weekends.  
\-Took AHCC for a couple weeks but stopped. I actually ended up getting sick for a few days.  
\-Up until March 2020, I used a diffuser almost everyday. Added organic lemongrass or frankincense essential oils.  
\-Tried to use natural products (wasn't consistent): deodorant, chapstick, shampoo/conditioner, toothpaste, and hand soap. 

My disclaimer is that I can't really say what did or didn't help. I think what's most important is to try not to stress, keep a positive attitude, maintain a healthy diet, and move your body. Meditation and journaling helped me when I started to feel stressed. Remember, most HPV clears on its own within 2 years.

I know how scary this can be. I originally created a Reddit account to find encouragement when I was told I had HPV. My inbox is open. Happy to offer support if anyone wants to talk or has questions.

Hope this helps someone feel less alone! You got this.

\*Smoothie recipe: 1 cup almond milk, half banana, handful of blueberries, 1 cup kale, 1 cup spinach, spoonful of almond butter, 1/2 avocado, 3 tsps Super Greens, 2 tsps Forever Beautiful, 1 tsp turmeric spice (subbed for 1 tsp of Mellow Yellow or the Garden of Life gummies), 1 tsp nutritional yeast."	0
"The Recap of the Great Debate As many of us know a traveller named [Mr Slow](https://www.reddit.com/user/Slow_Bet9860/) came to visit us recently and offered to have a friendly debate on this [pro-vax sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/twxwr8/comment/i3mg49b/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).  He came in with a strong claim that he doesn't believe there’s a pro Covid vaccine person he can’t beat in a debate.

That instantly piqued the interest of the pro-brain rot-clot shot-big bot advocates of the sub (such as u/BCovid22, u/Edges8, u/throwpillow6, u/bookofbooks, u/WWMRD2016, u/BrewtalDoom, u/UsedConcentrate) and I think I can speak for all that we thought we were in for a serious debate with serious science and irrefutable evidence.  It was going to be tough.

The Debater was asked for his best points supporting his stance that the vaccine is not safe.  He provided the following.

1. *The World Health Organization tracks the REPORTED side effects of every drug ever made. No childhood vaccine has had more than 20,000 reports. According to their database no drug in human history has ever had 300,000 incidents of adverse events. Most data scientists (even VAERS which is where some of the data gets pulled from)estimate 1-10% of adverse events and deaths get reported. The FDA even says this on their website. So how is it the Covid 19 vaccine has 3 million events, 10\* more reported than any drug in human history.*
2. *Filing a false VAERS report is a criminal charge offense and makes it clear it’s a criminal offense. We know most VAERS reports were done by physicians. We also know that filing a report for the average person is far from simple. VAERS says in plain English on their website that their biggest issue is underreporting and only a small fractional percentage gets reported. According to the FDA’s website they agree most studies show only 1-10% of adverse events (including deaths) get reported. That one sentence trumps everything else. If the current vaccine death count according to VAERS is 22k vaccine deaths in America, then what does that math tell you? 22k multiples by 1-10%? I’ve heard and defeated liberal arguments for this so I hope you have a clever response.*
3. *The greatest number of excess deaths (it’s a massive difference) happened at the height of the vaccine mandates. It was 35% higher than the height of the pandemic, and most people were vaxxed by this point.*
4. *The FDA has routinely rubber stamped dangerous drugs in the name of money, like how they took a bribe to get OxyContin FDA approved. The FDA also had no actual oversight on the clinical trials. They simply left it all up to Pfizer. Unfortunately, 2 whistleblowers from their clinical trials no longer employed by Pfizer shared similar stories about how trials were won.*
5. *The FDA also states in their report that giving a child the vaccine will yield 150-250 heart issues for every life saved. Not a good tradeoff.*

The debate began.

There were some good shots fired from Mr Slow but as time went on he was consistently unable to backup his points and found himself increasingly frustrated that he wasn't achieving total victory.  He did at times comment that [not a single point was disproved](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/twxwr8/comment/i3nkrox/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), [he destroyed everyone](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/twxwr8/comment/i3mcse6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), [nobody has beaten him on any debate](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/twxwr8/comment/i3kzrv4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), [he won every single time](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/twxwr8/comment/i3l46sq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and more.

All comments of a confident debater in his element letting his evidence speak for him.

And as all good debaters know you yourself get to choose if you won.

To the substance.  He provided a number of falsehoods and faulty reasoning.

For example he claimed the FDA took a bribe to get OxyContin approved and this is evidence of routinely rubber stamping dangerous drugs.  Unfortunately there is no evidence for a bribe occurring and [he was unable to provide any](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/twxwr8/comment/i3jl65u/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).  He never came back.

He pointed out that excess deaths happened at the height of the vaccine mandates and when it was shown to him that it was not true he decided to laser-focus on a small subset and claim victory.  In fact along the way [he lied about what a commenter said](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/twxwr8/comment/i3olacr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and tried to put words in their mouth.  When he was pressed on the moving of the goalposts he said [that is grasping for whatever nibbling one can find](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/twxwr8/comment/i3q6sph/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

A third falsehood he argued, which was a side point he had made, was that [there are 1500 side effects and they were listed in the Pfizer clinical trial report](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/twxwr8/comment/i3l3ip9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).  After some pressing he [shared a link](https://phmpt.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/5.3.6-postmarketing-experience.pdf) to the report which promptly showed that the [report was listing Adverse Events of Special Interest](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/twxwr8/comment/i3ognsw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and not side effects.  It was explained to him [repeatedly](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/twxwr8/comment/i3opb43/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that they are [not the same](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/twxwr8/comment/i3ou20f/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) but he was stubborn in his belief that side effects, adverse events and AESI are all the same and that AESI are all things that actually happened.  He argued [that showing the things are different is not an argument for his point that they are the same](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/twxwr8/comment/i3otnya/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

These were my favourite points and comments of his and will leave it for now.

As the debate petered out the Debater seemed frustrated and began posting comments such as [the rules should be about discovering truth](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/twxwr8/comment/i3q7k81/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) as he clung on to falsehoods and that [only losers cling to details](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/twxwr8/comment/i3q0ijd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) as his details were false.

"Trans, high-risk HPV, suicidal About a year and a half ago, aged 34, I had my first ever cervical smear. I’m a trans man and had been on hormones for several years, but I was having monthly bleeding despite the testosterone, and nobody could give me a good reason as to why. 

I very reluctantly consented to a smear, to see if there might be something wrong ‘down there.’ The results came back with moderate high-grade dyskaryosis and positive for low-risk HPV. I was devastated. 

I hadn’t been vaccinated for HPV as a teenager because it made me horribly dysphoric to be vaccinated for something that (at the time) was only indicated for use in girls and young women. I never thought I would have sex, anyway, so it seemed like something that would be neither here nor there.

I was taken advantage of by a friend and his partner when I was in my late 20s. It caused a spiral into terror about STIs, and I got the HPV vaccine series. 

After the smear with the upsetting results, the GP sent me to colposcopy for further tests. The results of that, while still positive for low-risk HPV, showed no dyskaryosis. That was a relief, but it still prompted me to finally pursue a hysterectomy: the process of having those exams was so person-destroying that I knew I couldn’t keep doing them, and I wanted to be free of those parts of my body that had been such a source of grief.

At colposcopy’s recommendation, I went back for a vault smear post-hysterectomy to rule out any abnormal results. Those results just came back: now it’s low-grade dyskaryosis and HIGH RISK HPV.

I don’t know what to do. For the first time in my life, I’m living with a partner, and sex (which I once thought I would never have) has become part of how I relate to and love him. He seems to prefer oral and frontal sex, as they’re easier; I prefer anal sex, as it makes me less dysphoric. 

But now all I can think is that I have cancer-causing cells all over my body. I feel disgusting and diseased, and any post-hysterectomy feeling of finally being safe is gone. I can’t believe I’ll never be free of this body, even after surgery. I can’t believe I didn’t help myself when I was younger by getting vaccinated. I can’t deal with the humiliation of having to think about and be examined here. It feels like punishment and a reminder that I deserve shit. 

I got the news last night and beat the shit out of myself. I should wake up with a black eye and burst blood vessels, but that doesn’t feel like enough: everything in the flat and everywhere outside seems like a weapon with which I could hurt myself or a place to go to die. My mental health was already at a terrible low.  I don’t want to be around anymore. I’m tired and empty of everything except disease. I want to leave. "	0

"It is just me or???? I was talking about life with my fiancé today and at some point the words “it’s not my fault I got cancer” came out of my mouth and the conversation went on and eventually ended. And now I’m here in my own thoughts thinking: it actually is my fault. 

Idk girls, with cervical cancer it’s just different. There’s some shame that comes with the diagnosis. I constantly think if I would’ve just kept up with my Pap smears and not let life get in the way things would be different. Most importantly, I would still have my uterus. There’s obviously regret there, I should’ve prioritized my self and my health. And then there’s obviously the most frustrating part of it all, HPV! If only I wouldn’t have caught this damn STD. 

I constantly feel like I should’ve been more careful. I was never “promiscuous” or sleeping around but I trusted the wrong person when I was younger. I should’ve always used protection and not assumed just because you loved someone and they supposedly “loved you” that this meant they would respect you enough to not sleep around and give you an STD- a cancer causing STD at that. I was naive and fucking stupid. I often think of my ex and all I can imagine myself saying to him is, “you gave me cancer, because of you I have cancer, and I will always hate you for that.” I often find myself wishing he would get some sort of cancer too. I know it’s sick but I’m only human. And I guess I’m being so honest right now it’s ugly. But this is the damn ugly truth. I will never be capable of causing harm to him or anyone for that matter but I definitely do not wish him well. I hope karma takes care of his ass. I hope he gets it a million times worse than I have. 

I guess I’m just having a moment. Although I often find myself thinking about all of this, I don’t dwell on it and try not to stay in this dark mental place for too long. 

Before anyone suggests it, I know I need talk therapy. I will definitely be going to therapy as soon as I’m up for it. But not right now. At the moment I just don’t feel like physically talking to anyone. I’m trying to go through the motions on my own and eventually when I’m ready, I would like to speak to a professional that can help me navigate this new normal. 

Anywho, thanks for reading. Xoxo"	-1

Is the COVID vaccine important I’ve been having so much anxiety about this and I don’t know what to believe anymore. My parents want me to put the vaccine because I live under their roof and they’re all vaccinated they say the new delta virus is spreading and that they’re safer with the vaccines than unvaccinated people. I see so many stories and theories on why NOT to get it. And I also see many stories on why you should get it. The stories that scared me the most about getting the vaccine is the girl who got paralyzed and all the people that have died because they’ve got it. The theories of more government control and getting rid people because dog world over population is scary. And also people that say nurses saying that dying covid patients are saying they should of gotten the vaccine regret not getting it. This whole situation is giving me bad anxiety and I don’t even know what to put in my own body. Any advice,	-1
"Cheating gf My girlfriend and I have been together for about 8 years. And now recently she went to her gyno, and she told her she was HPV positive. Before that she had these crazy nights out where she didnt come home before 6-7 in the morning and i had to call her to know where she was and basically tell her to get the home, because she is a grown woman and a mother, not some 20 year old chick. I checked snappmap when i woke up in the morning and she was at different houses but told me she was with her friends at afterparties. 
I’ve had previous partners and so have she, but there has never been any problems with std’s. 
So now i’m sitting here with a weird feeling about if she have been cheating on me and catched it from someone else and never told me about it or if we have had it from long before. 
This virus is hell for relationships and i just need someone to tell me something i don’t know about the virus that may ease my mind."	0
"Coming to terms with my diagnosis Reading the posts of others has made me brave enough to share my story.  I'm not huge on social media and I've only shared my diagnosis with a handful of close people.  It's been a whirlwind of emotions the past two months and hard to process.  

I'm in a holding pattern the next few weeks waiting for surgery and final staging.  My hysterectomy and lymph dye tests are scheduled for Jan 26th.  

How we got here:

I've had HPV since my first teenage pap and they didn't have a vaccine back then and it was “too late"" by the time they did.  I turn 40 in March.  Don't know yet if my situation is HPV related or what type of cancer I have.  I had a huge gap in healthcare for four years due to covid and a lack of health insurance.  I have a great WFH job now with excellent benefits and I am so thankful for that right now.

My pap results in November revealed a “high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion with features suspicious for invasion”.  I had a LEEP procedure and the biopsy results were, “Moderate and severe squamous dysplasia (CIN 2 and CIN 3 or HSIL).”  Both samples had clear margins.  

They found a 5.8 cm complex, hypervascular mass in my cervix during an ultrasound.  I had an
endometrial biopsy and those results were “features concerning for endometrioid carcinoma (FIGO grade 1) are present but are qualitatively/or quantitatively insufficiently developed to establish a definitive diagnosis of carcinoma.”   

I was referred to an OB oncologist that I saw on December 18th for a consultation.  She immediately scheduled me for my hysterectomy and an MRI.  It confirmed stage 1B3 cervical cancer with a 5cm endocervical maglignant tumor and lymph nodes concerning for nodal metastatic disease, some are highly suspect and some are moderate. 

To say I'm scared is putting it mildly.  I'm terrified.  My biggest worry is that they will open me up and close me right back up.  I try not to think about it but knowing possibilities helps me process better. I'm steeling myself for a fight but hope it isn't needed.  

My husband is my rock and without him I'd be lost.  I'm autistic and this makes doctor visits and anything social very hard for me.  He is there for everything from holding my hand to talking to the doctors.  I forget the details of conversations or can't ask the questions I have properly.  He makes sure nothing is unsaid or unasked.  Our ten year marriage anniversary is in April. I hope to celebrate ten more again and again until we're both old and decrepit. 

I don't know how to stop writing, I could go on to post a novel of this experience and how it's affected me.  So I'll just say, thank you for reading.  Hugs are appreciated.  I can't get enough of them these days."	0

I tested positive for HR HPV last year in March. I was determined to get rid of it. I took AHCC, green tea everyday, folate, probiotic and zinc for 6 months straight. 

After 6 months, I just continued drinking green tea everyday and probiotics. I was off and on the AHCC due to it being expensive. I got retested and I’m negative HR HPV. It is possible.

I SIMPLY TOLD WHAT HAPPENED TO ME SINCE THE VACCINE. YOUR LEVEL OF CENSORSHIP IS BEYOND BELIEF! SEEMS TO ME YOU ARE THE RIGHT WING DICTATORS.

Hey guys, this probably has been discused already but I'd like to know if either of you have experienced some of the same side effects that I have after the vaccination for the covid 19.

Before I was eligible for the vaccine there were some weird news about the vaccine making grow sizes of the breast on women and after that some about menstrual irregularities too. I could care less about the fertility thread since I don't want children. But I did ask about the breast growth and some people working with doctors told me that they were lies and others that it was just swelling and it'd pass.

I had my first two shots in July and August and I indeed experienced the breast growth and some menstrual delay and less than usual, and I had a third shot in December.

I feel bad because the ""swelling"" is not going away after all these months and I am fu\*\*\*\* 36 years old so I don't thing it is normal to keep growing at this age.

Somebody can relate? I don't know, maybe it is a bad coincidence and there is something else that is wrong with me, but seriously I'll aprecciate some feedback!"	-1

"Mum urges vaccine push and shares how son died after catching measles Gemma Larkman-Jones wants more parents to consider having their children vaccinated sooner.
Her son, Samuel, developed a rare form of brain inflammation after catching measles, and died in 2019.

""I honestly think that if people knew that this was a possibility they would vaccinate more,"" Ms Larkman-Jones, 45, of Brixton, south London, told the PA Media news agency.

Ms Larkman-Jones believes Samuel's death was avoidable had he been vaccinated with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab, but she said he had been put on a delayed vaccination programme.

""People just think it's a bit of a temperature, but I think they've forgotten that people can go blind, people can go deaf, people who seemingly sailed through measles can end up years down the line with SSPE,"" she said.

""I honestly do believe that people just think that measles, like chickenpox, is part of being a child and it's so not.

""I think (my story) will make people think 'although it's a risk, it's still a risk, am I going to risk my child dying for something that he doesn't need to?'"""	0

"Rise in chronic diseases, autism, diabetes, cancer, auto immune diseases CDC itself, the vaccine proponents company, admit that rates of diabetes, and obesity have risen high amounts over the last 40 years. 

The rates of auto immune diseases have on average risen from 15 per year in 1970 to about 400 per year in 2010.

The rates of autism has risen too, by 50 fold! 50 times. Over the past 50 years. Too much to be explained by simple advances in technology, and diagnosis prevelancy. 

The rates of chronic diseases in children under 18 has risen from 10% in the 1960s, to 55% in the last 2 years. 

The rates of diabetes has Risen from 2% in 1960 to 7% in 2018.

The rate of cancer has Risen from 300000 per year in 1969, to 650000 per year in 2018.

The rates of asthma allergic rhinitis and disabling asthma and atopic eczema, have all risen from around 0.1% in 1969 all the way to 1% to 10% in 2000. 

The rates of food allergies have risen from 6 in 1 million in 1988 to 30 in 1 million in 2000.

Maybe we need to stop injecting things, into our kids, that mess with and confuse their immune systems in ways that it naturally never experiences or rarely does. And maybe we need to stop giving treatment for diseases, and instead try to prevent them with education, better health and diet, exercise, better hygiene and being less reliant on medication and drugs and technology.

Maybe other factors are at play, I admit, but maybe one place to look, is the very thing that is related wholly to the immune system, the bloodstream, the gut, and then in turn the brain.
So, who's lookin? I don't see GSK, MERCK, CDC, FDA, or any of the pharmaceutical companies doing it? Who will?

Right now, we need is common sense.
Not technology.

Technology is great, but we need to be careful not to rely on it, and lose our natural abilities and skills."	-1

"High Risk HPV, male, worried about anal cancer- please read and help. Hi all, 

To the shock and dismay of both my wife and I, she found out she had high risk HPV this past November (she had actually tested positive for it in summer of 2017, but was not made aware of this until Nov 18). Before me, she hasn’t had sex since 2010, and she and I hadn’t started having sex until 2014 (no, I’m not worried about infidelity). As far as she knows, no testing that she has ever done has come back with being HPV positive, so this is obviously the case of her immune system suppressing it, and then all of the sudden coming back. We aren’t sure of her strain but we do know that it’s not 16, 18, or 45.  When she spoke with the nurse about it, the nurse acted like it was no big deal.  Her cervical cells, thankfully, came back normal.  

Now, our main worry is about a lump I have inside of my anus. I only know about it because it “peeks” out when I have a bowel movement. From everything I’m finding online, this sounds like it’s more than likely an internal hemorrhoid that is prolapsing. After a bowel movement last week, I had my wife look and she said it looks just like the hemorrhoid she had last year, and just like all other hemorrhoid photos she found online. Although this puts us at ease, we are still worried to death that it’s anal cancer, especially since an ultrasound I had done on my chest area came back with either a “cyst or a vessel” on my liver- what’s worrisome about this is that the liver is one of the first places that anal cancer spreads to.  So, we are afraid that this “cyst or vessel” is actually a tumor. I have a CT scan in two days, so I will know more then. I’m still waiting for the colorectal center to call to get an appointment for my lump/hemorrhoid.  

Now, even if my lump is a hemorrhoid, that doesn’t mean that anal cancer isn’t lurking up in there, also. I’ve read that HPV takes 20-30 years on average to turn into cancer, and that all HPV-related cancers always have pre-cancer cells. 
Given our sex and HPV timeline, is it possible/likely that I could already have anal cancer, and if so, that it’s already spread to my liver? I’ve scoured the internet and there’s really not a whole lot of info about anal cancer timelines, and I haven’t found anything about it on this sub. Any help is greatly appreciated, anything to put my mind at ease until we get test results."	0

"I think it's unjust that vaccines are only allowed to be discussed from one side. It's truly sad how biased we've become.  You can only hear one side of the story. Anything that contradicts the main narrative is censored. Havent we've been taught that that you should hear both sides of the story before assuming? People should be allowed to speak up for what they believe. Whether it's true, or false. That's what our 1st amendment is for. Freedom of speech.. How can anyone oppose to that? You know, theres families that has been affected by some of these vaccines. People have died.. They all deserve to  to warn others of the potential side effects. Just because it hasent happened to you, doesnt mean that your opinion is valid. Learn how to be more open minded and hear others out. You're not always right in life, as much as you think you are lol. 
Can someone answer this.. what would be the main objective if everyone knowingly was spreading the misinformation? What would be the purpose to that? What is the ""anti-vaxxers"" motive? 
Question for the ""pro-vaxxers"". Why do most of you guys think vaccines are our only hope? Why doesnt anyone mention natural remedies or just any methods to non pharmaceutical medicines? Shouldnt we be doing everything we can to be healthy. I have friends who are up to date on all of their shots, and they are sick quite more often than I am. Just interesting. Because logic tells me that their immune system should better protect them from sicknessess right? 
Also, stop assuming peoples intelligence based from what they believe. That is foolishness in itself. Hopefully this post will atleast make you consider what I'm saying. If not, atleast i got a rise out of yous.

"DIAGNOSED CIN 3- RECOMMENDED FOR FULL HYSTERECTOMY In 2018 I was bleeding, I was experiencing abnormal bleeding. I had 2 kids and was married. I wasn't worried about STDS.

I went to a gyn and they insisted I was not due for a pap, I was 3 into my 5 years of the medical recommendation and therefore was almost being talked out of a pap as my insurance ""might"" not cover it.

I demanded a pap, I explained I was experiencing light pink bleeding after sex, and intermittent bleeding all month long. I had watery discharge and an off smell. I had and still have the paraguard IUD (non-hormone, copper). My youngest child was about 5-yrs old.

They did a pap. And Thank god they did. I was diagnosed with CIN3. The gyn recommended a full hysterectomy, she informed me that this was the best way to avoid cerrvical cancers. She urged me to be grateful for my children I already birthed and to think logically. I was terrified and in shock.

We did a leep.

I declined follow-up for a hysterectomy, and started my own research. I personally found HPV causes 95% of abnormal cell changes in the cervix. HPV is a virus that can be dormant and reemerge when your immune system is weak. I have no idea when I contracted HPV, it could have been years before I met my spouse or he could have given it to me. 80% of sexually active people have been infected. There are 100's of strains of HPV virus. The kind that cause genital warts are not the same as the strains that cause cancer. Your immune system will usually Clear an HPV infection but overtime this can reemerge. Think Cold sore or herpes simplex 1. You can get a cold sore when your immune system is low but most of the time your body keeps that virus in check and you dont walk around with coldsores all year long. That virus remains with you for your life however. All viruses do actually.

I went back appx. 7-8 months later for a follow-up pap and my cells showed regression to CIN2. I had abnormal cells in the canal of my cervix but they weren't ""glandular"" based on the tissue pathology had.. It was squamous not glandular but the abnormalities protruded into my cervical canal and results were unknown if they actually biopsied the entire region of abnormality and therefore the gyn STILL recommended a hysterectomy. I was over it. I decided to contact a GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGIST. I had to self refer, and that's OK. They agreed to see me after review of my records and were shocked I hadn't been physician referred.

I met with this lady and she told me I DID NOT NEED A HYSTERECTOMY yet. She wanted to review her own biopsy from my body and I underwent cold knife CONE procdure with her under general anesthesia.

She listened to me and my concerns about procedures on my cervix that could impact my future fertility. She assured she would be as careful as possible with this in mind.

My cone biopsy showed NO HPV, and normal cells. I was healthy. In a matter of 12 months, I went from CIN3 on track for a hysterectomy to a completely healthy reproductive system. I have my cervix and uterus and am doing just fine today.

I have to have a pap every year now and I am OK with that. I just had one in Sept. 2020 and still no HPV or abnormal cells.

One thing I know when I was diagnosed with CIN3 is I wasn't getting a lot of sleep, and I wasn't taking care of myself. Smoking is also a huge risk for cervical cancer.

I hope this brings knowledge and comfort to women who read. Your story might be totally different and I urge you to share it to begin the discussion.

Peace and love to all of you!"	1
"HPV Subreddit for Women If you're a woman, I highly encourage you to join this community for women with HPV. 

I think we can all agree that there is a difference between men and women with HPV. I've been using Reddit as a resource to gain more perspective and knowledge about this virus. I figured a separate community for women will be beneficial to discuss our experiences with it. 

This is a safe space for women and girls who want to talk about all things HPV-related! Hope to see you there <3 ! 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPVWomen/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPVWomen/)

Edit: This isn’t an attempt to exclude men from HPV-related issues so I will not be responding to any comments of that nature. If you have issues with previous comments that were made, I have addressed them in the comments below. I have also fixed my statements to be more inclusive and understanding to all cases of HPV. I am not here to offend anyone and I’m in full agreement that HPV sucks for anyone going through it. This new community has nothing to do with men and once again, is not in attempt to exclude men from complications. Be well everyone."	0
"HPV. India. Sex and Taboo. Community Intro I, 24F, recently discovered that I have HPV warts on my genitalia. While I figure out treatment, run around to doctors, try to take my zinc and multivitamins, google if podophyllum is alright or not, there is this huge thing at the back of my mind and that is 

""Log kya kahenge""

This entire shame. Doctors mildly judging. Fear of judgement. The entire taboo that surrounds it adds much more fear to the experience. Creating this community, specifically for India, cause well, though we are the country that gave the world the Kamasutra, healthy talk about sex and the issues around it are zero. 

Hoping to have this as a healthy space for us to help fellow Indians with HPV, offer support and reassurance, share experiences, ease our fears."	0
I'm immune compromised it's been six months since my Last covid shot and I was just refused at my local Health department. As I said I am immune compromised i was refused a shot based on the fact that the government hasn't any more recommendations. I don't know what to do . I asked  the woman if she knew how long the vaccine helps with amunities for I think the shot only works for 4 to 6 months  and she put me on hold as she wasn't sure and proceeded to tell me I was right. I asked why can't I just have the shot then if the last one is out of my system she said it would show as an error in the system. They told me just to mask up and keep distance and wash hands. I've been doing that for 3 years.  She said she can't give me more until government recommendations are up can they refuse to give me a shot?.	-1

"Flu Vaccine Question So I actually posted earlier about how I used to be anti vax and my kid was on a spread out schedule. Sorry to spam but I just had a thought.

I've never had a flu vacvine, and I have never had the flu. Does that mean my immune system is barely equipt to deal with the flu if I did get it, and does that mean it could actually be dangerous for me if I got it?"	0
"32y.o, adenocarcinoma (at least) in situ Hello, I have been lurking this page ever since my pathology report came back with AIS. Like many of you, this has been a journey. I spiraled initially then came to my senses. This all started because I decided to (finally) establish a pcp in January of this year and went in for an annual assessment. She offered to do a pap and I said sure since I haven't had one in years. No signs or symptoms. Normal periods. No pain anywhere. When she called with results I  was taken aback but also not fully surprised since I haven't had a pap in a while. Referred to an OBGYN, did a colposcopy which should HR HPV, not 16 & 18. Got told I should do a LEEP. Scheduled a LEEP in April, initial results came back basically the same but CIN2 maybe 3. Told to come back in 6 months and monitor. A month later, I get a phone call from my OBGYN saying that the biopsies were sent to a specific cancer lab (Memorial Sloan) and that they actually found adenocarcinoma (gastric type) at least in situ in my endocervix. Can't rule out if it's invasive. And CIN2 ectocervix. Just glad that someone in the lab decided to send my sample out. And that my pcp offered a pap. Forever grateful to them.

It was a few days after my birthday when I was told the news and I went a little crazy. I'm a nurse and see hysterectomy patients every so often. I've seen the side effects. The complications. And I was completely consumed by this diagnosis.

I've been vegan 8 years. I work out 4-5 times a week (yoga, weight trainining & running). No chronic issues. Don't smoke. Rarely drink. Walk almost 4-5 miles daily because of my dogs. I'm the health conscious one in my family, nagging everyone to get screenings. Then this happens. I have no kids and have always been on the fence with having them. I feel like this is a sign that I just wasn't meant for children and I'm ok with that honestly.

I met with my oncologist today who has me scheduled for a cone biopsy next month to determine my plan. Part of me wants to yeet the uterus completely. But a part of me also remembers the patients with complications. Ostomies. Fistulas. Incontinence. SBOs. It's not healthy to think that way and I'm trying not to. If I wasn't a nurse I think I may feel better about this.

Just want to vent and connect with anyone who may be in a similar situation. Reading testimonials helps a lot. But can also be extremely triggering because everyone's cancer journey is so personalized. Thank you all for being here and writing your stories. And i'm sorry that we're all going through this."	0
"in the process of getting rabies vaccines out of an abundance of caution, now afraid the vaccine could kill me... Basically found a fang like mark on my arm, and the ER doc said it was extremely unlikely to be a bat bite if I don't remember seeing a bat. Despite all that he could see I was very worried so he recommended to just get the rabies treatment anyways... My second shot is supposed to be tomorrow.

But, now I'm terrified by the possibility that the live virus inactivation process during vaccine manufacturing could accidentally leave some live virus particles behind and it could kill me. I realize the odds are low, but I've never dealt with a virus with a 100% kill rate, so I'm completely freaking out. One stray cluster of particles, and its certain death with a 1 to 3 month delay.

There have been one or two cases where virus inactivation failed in the last couple of decades, but no known cases of it actually getting injected into a person and killing them. That said, millions of people get vaccinations every year, but only a few thousand get rabies vaccines so there isn't much data.

I'm so freaked out. I'm trusting people who are in a manufacturing plant who have their own problems and distractions in life to do their job correctly not realizing one mistake in Q/A and they could kill hundreds of people with a tainted vaccine batch..."	-1
"The sheer ignorance and stupidity from pro vaxxers is just mind boggling. I often find myself, in bewilderment, thinking, ""how in the world can people be soo blind and delusional?""

Like just recently I saw a comment with 800 upvotes saying that anti vaxxers are the fear mongering ones, making people fear vaccines with death and injury stories so they can get money for vitamin C supliments and essential oils. (As if essential oils has anything to do with the whole topic, pro vaxxers use them all the time).

It's just soo insane. I can never wrap my head around the insanity of it all. It's really quite amazing that a bunch of random teens online can have such similar bullshit views and beliefs, as though they all went to the a vaccine camp, the same one... But obviously not, so how do they come up with these identical bullshitisms?"	-1

"LSIL and HPV positive. 2 years ago it was ASCUS. Got letter for colonoscopy in 8 months due to pregnancy (otherwise would have been 6 months) Hi Guys!!

I am 27 and 2 years ago I went to have my first pap smear as they start in my city at the age of 25. I had ASCUS as result and other invitation for new pap smear 2 years later (which is this year). I am currently 21 weeks pregnant and pregnancy has gone super well so far. I went for the pap smear and got my results back (it took like 2 months almost). It seems that I have LSIL changes due to positive HPV.

I called the doctor about it and we talked about the results and pregnancy. These are quite common results and doctor said he recommendes colonoscopy as the changes have not dissapeard. It made me very worried. He said taking a biopsy can trigger your own body to start to work trough getting rid of the virus. He said they want to see are the cell changes also LSIL or something else. I do hope just LSIL but then again my ASCUS changed too. I am scared for LOOP treatment as I would like to have more kids and I am scared it would affect negatively to future pregnancies. Doctor said that results of the biopsy will tell the treatment - either follow it or treat it. He said also the wait time for these changes are about 6 months as they can heal still on their own. 

He did not see any issue by postoning the time from 6 months to 8 months which is after my due date (December) the colonoscopy as the results don’t seem serious to him - after birth its 2 months at least for recovery. If it would seem bad they would do it already for me. Kinda good news then….

Just wanted to ask has anyone healed from LSIL and avoided the LOOP treatment? I do hope its just LSIL findings again…. Makes me very stressed this whole thing ??"	0
Cleared High Risk HPV in exactly 3 months. Hey everyone. Back in February, I tested positive for High Risk HPV- negative for types 16 18/45. Last week I was retested and my results came back today... NEGATIVE. I am so happy I was able to clear it on my own. I changed my eating habits by adding a lot more fruits and vegetables to my already vegan diet. I started taking b12, vitamin d, vitamin C and folic acid daily. I also started exercising (mostly walking) 5-6 days a week. I’m not sure if this is how I cleared the virus- but I’ll take it. I was excited to share my good news and I wish everyone else good luck!	0
"I really think that the main reason this mad vaccine program is continuing is not because of money, but because we've gone past the point of no return, and to accept that it was such a mistake is too detrimental to the reputation of so many people. Not only to the reputation but the conscience and the comfort of individuals on all walks of life from doctors to plumbers.

Doctors would have to accept being complicit in a scam that's hurt a lot of people."	-1
My friend’s daughter won’t let her met her baby unless she is vaccinated? They are not speaking.  My friend doesn’t want to get the Covid vaccine and her daughter said she will never meet her grandchild until she is vaccinated.  Most people are siding with her daughter.  I do understand it’s her child and she can do what she wants but we know now that the vaccine doesn’t stop you from getting it or spreading it so why would it be an issue?	0
"New Here -- Proton therapy Question Hi everyone. I just got diagnosed with tonsil cancer, specifically SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA WITH BASALOID FEATURESP16 IS POSITIVE (HPV ASSOCIATED). I've been reading just about everything I can find and I have read a few people talking about Proton therapy. 

Has anyone tried this and why did you choose that treatment over traditional radiation?

Fortunately there is a Proton Therapy Center in Atlanta (Emory) so this may be an option for me.

Thanks in advance for the replies!"	0
Need support to quit vaping to prevent abnormal Pap smears I had my LEEP done in March of this year to get CIN 3 cells removed (which was successful with negative margins). However, my 6-month follow up pap showed LSIL CIN 1 cells again (with negative HPV though). I’ve done a lot to have a better lifestyle but I still vape socially at parties sometimes. I don’t really see any other why I would I have an abnormal pap 6 months after my LEEP. How do I stop?	0
"I had my post op appt today I had my appointment today, post LEEP
Next steps are more than likely a partial hysterectomy. the type of high-risk HPV I have didn't clear with my procedure, They grabbed the abnormal cells that were there which were a large area, due to the HPV we know the cells will come back we just don't know how aggressive it will be when it does. I'm 25 but I have 2 kids already, I guess I am a little sad but idk I just haven't really processed it all"	0
"Confronting someone who exposed me to STD’s? Not sure if this is the best subreddit for this question, but I figured I’d give it a shot.

I’m incredibly livid about it. I have my vaccinations and am clean, but feel dirty despite it. I want to confront him about this, but I don’t know how to go about it. Is it even worth it? And if so, how do I initiative and navigate this conversation?"	0
Imposible to argue with antivax people Family member is 100%+ antivax, anti-medicine.. always natural way type of person. I expect it will be difficult to keep a good relationship with this person in the future especially when kids are involved. The annoying part that it is like impossible to argue with this person because they’ve research vaccines so much and have a good argument for everything. The crappy thing is that since I believe in vaccines, I didn’t spend as much time researching them so I don’t have good arguments to go against this person. Just annoying. This antivax person believes that you can spread the sickness after getting a vaccine so asked to not be around his antivax kids for a couple of days after vaccines. And also said that vaccinated kids can pass on illness just as much as antivax kids and actually vaccinated kids are more likely to infect a baby than antivax because vaccinated kids symptoms are more hidden due to the vaccine and parents giving meds to kill the fever and then act like the vaccinated kid is not sick anymore. Just annoying.	0
"Is it true that most AntiVaxxers are Pro White, Pro Nationalist, Pro Nazi? I mean it makes sense. Nazi eugenics is the only thing that could be more scientific, than the studies into why vaccines cause autism.

sister boyfriend is antivax so my sisters boyfriend got a job recently but he got told today that if he doesn’t have the covid vax he can’t work with the crew. my sister tells me about it and i said “damn he should just get the vax” and my sister got so mad at me for saying that. this man is fully antivax like no vaccines at all (his whole family is too) and my sister wants me to accept this so badly like girl he’s your boyfriend not mine I don’t have to be fine with the fact that he’s antivax. im totally fine respecting other peoples choices but that doesn’t mean i have to agree with them and it seems like my sister wants me to full on agree with her boyfriend and be mad at the fact that he won’t be able to work because he won’t get a vaccine…	-1
"Potentially deadly vaccine resistant Centaurus variant could be spreading like wildfire, yet no one cares Centaurus was first detected in India just two months ago, and has since been found all over the world. It is said to be resistant to previous immunity (a euphemism for the vaccine is useless), and more infectious than any previous variant, which seems to be true as cases are exploding (up 30% in the UK last week).

But everyone just assumes this is a repeat of Omicron, which was just a very infectious flu. Health institutions just say there's not enough data and are taking no actions.

What's so disturbing about this is that GVDB warned in May that we'd see a vaccine resistant variant by now, a theory supported by Robert Malone. GVDB said that this variant would seek out the vaccinated, because it evolved to attach itself effortlessly to their vaccine spike proteins. And that this would result in massed deaths among the vaccinated, which I fear is a grave understatement, I expect 99% death rate.

Meaning we could be looking at the single greatest disaster in human history, and no one is even worried. I for one am stocking up on food for the first time this pandemic."	0
"Quit Vaping I need advice.

I had a LEEP and I really need to quit vaping to help clear up my HPV. I know even if I quit, I will still have it but I’m told if I quit and my immune system will help fight off the HPV. 

Has anyone successfully quit without gaining a ton of weight? The last time I quit, I gained roughly 50 pounds and I am currently overweight (but currently working on that and I’ve lost 40 pounds already). 

I am 33. Me and my husband want to have kids in the future, so I know quitting is important and so is losing weight but I’m honestly scared to gain that 40 pounds back if I quit. "	0
"Fibroblasts in vaccines? I just saw a vaccine ingredient list that included a lot of cell culture medium and some vaccines that were listed as having the dreaded fibroblasts. While I can imagine that even purified vaccines could contain some bovine serum albumin, it surprises me that any vaccine would actually have cells in them.

I’ve said before that this wouldn’t be the case. I got a doctorate in virology and we always ran viruses through filters and ultra centrifugation when we needed pure viruses. I also worked for a gene therapy company that filtered out 293 cells when producing adenovirus vectors.

So am I seeing sloppy writing, or are some vaccines not being filtered?"	-1
"How you can help fight disinformation on Reddit There is a lot of disinformation relating to the Coronavirus pandemic on Reddit, ranging from misconceptions about PPE &amp; the vaccine to unsafe medical advice which could easily cause harm. More than 1500 communities on reddit have called for the admins to take action.  There have been numerous articles covering both the open letter and reddit's response. This thread will serve as a place to discuss and link these articles, along with any other examples of covid misinformation on the site.

This thread will also be a place to gather the type of content that we protest against. 


[Here is an example of dangerous content, that should be reported.](https://i.imgur.com/TBpFT9o.png)

While we do not agree with the reply from admins which framed counterfactual, dangerous propaganda as ""just an alternative viewpoint"" that reply also provided us with handles on how to move forward within existing content policy. 

In his reply, Mr. Huffman told us what redditors may not do to protest, but he also told us what we can do. He explicitly wrote that they will action against communities that violate their rules, including fraud and encouraging harm. Unfortunately, and unacknowledged by /u/spez' response,  the disinformation that we are protesting against does exactly that. It encourages harm.

This is where we need *your* help. If you find comments and threads that violate this rule then **report them** as disinformation via the link you can find at the bottom of this text. This is not a partisan issue. This pandemic affects us all, and we should all work together to keep people safe and informed during these difficult times.

We will collate everything that all of us together find into a spreadsheet that we will present to admins via a different reporting channel. By working within the rules that reddit laid out for content on this platform we stand the most chance to actually achieve our goal. Convincing people to take actions that are harmful to their health, that may even result in their deaths, has no place on this website.

We look forward to working together with everyone to make reddit a better place.

Meningitis vaccine I have state insurance in NY and trying to find out if there was really a shortage or if state Medicaid insurance would be the reason our doctor “didn’t” have the vaccine? Can anyone explain how this works with insurance because I looked on the CDC website and didn’t see any shortage listed. The same doctor that said they didn’t have this vaccine however was vaccinating others with what was supposedly a shortage but when calling the office they asked what insurance carrier we had. Why would it have mattered what insurance we were on but doctor said there was a shortage for the same vaccine we were suppose to get? I just am a bit confused if doctor lied or I’m missing something with understanding how insurance works.	0

"Goodbye to this sub I've been in therapy for a year and I finally told my therapist (I'm so ashamed I was afraid of even telling her) about this.

She couldn't believe I am still thinking about this. She told me I've been wart-free for almost 4 years, I've had 3 different doctors tell me to live a 100% normal sexual and social life. She told me lots and lots of people get this and then get cured over time. That this is my anxiety disorder flaring up. She told me to stop listening to that voice that reminds me of this every now and then. To stop reading about HPV. To LET IT GO.

So I'm letting go. It's not healthy for me to be looking at this sub. If I'm going back to my normal life, I'm going back to one where I didn't even know this sub existed.

Goodbye and good luck to everyone. You'll get better. Phisically and mentally."	1
"Are we getting any closer to a universal Covid vaccine? Back in 2020, it seemed like every scientist on the planet was working simultaneously, full steam ahead, on the Covid-19 vaccine. Thankfully, they produced one - actually, more than one. Thank you science! At the time, there was a lot of talk that there could someday be a universal vaccine that could prevent or block infection from ALL variants of Covid-19, or, even better, from all coronaviruses.

Four years later, where do we stand now? Has any progress been made on this? Are we getting closer to a universal Covid vaccine? Do scientists even care about Covid at all anymore? We never hear about Covid or vaccine research in the news anymore. Meanwhile, millions of people are still being infected with it every year, and the most vulnerable are still dying.

\>Not sure but maybe some other vaccines

"Micro invasive squamous cell carcinoma after Leep (Ia1 stage) I am 38years old, no kids, HPv16.
I had my first LEEP done end of June because of my recurrent HPV16 (at least first detected in 2015). My last Pap in April showed ASC-h, then decided the LEEP. ( I had a punch biopsy in April where CIN2 was found)
The leep results were shocking:
I have CIN 2 with intraglandular extension. Not sure what that means. Cin 2 goes from 14h to 22h however the pathologist says that even the area is large the CIN2 is kind of an “splash” unlike an even area all covered with the lesion.
On the CIN2 area was found a FOCUS of cell squamous carcinoma ( it says micro invasive as the size is 1mm x 1mm) the margins of the SCC are clean. However the margins of the CIN2 are not clean at the endocervical part but clear at the ectocervical part. No lymphs involved. ECC performed just after the LEEP is clear no lesion detected. 

I would really appreciate having your comments about what your experience has being if someone has come along a similar diagnosis. I am out of my mind!"	0
"Can a doctor/general practitioner perform some sort of test to inform you of what vaccines you’ve received in the past? Long story short, my mother has always been slightly anti-vax since having kids. She got us any absolutely mandatory vaccinations for school and stuff but apparently my sister and I didn’t receive every vaccine that most children might. Now that I’m an adult and understand the importance of vaccines, I wanted to find out which vaccines I received and which ones I didn’t. My parent have never been good at organizing records so my immunization records mind as well not exist.

All that to ask: can a healthcare professional perform some test like a blood test for example, that could give a list of vaccines I’ve received and the ones I haven’t? I’d call my family doctor except she just left the area and I haven’t found a new general practitioner yet. Thanks for any help."	1

"reaction to monkeypox/smallpox vaccine Hello! I'm new to reddit, so I hope I'm posting in the right place.

Last Sunday, I got the monkeypox/smallpox vaccine. I'm making sure all my shots are up to date before the new year. However I'm having a small reaction to it - a small bump under the skin (which google has assured me is normal and should go away within 2-3 weeks).  Additionally, two weeks ago I got my covid shot and my HPV vax in the same arm. I feel like the monkeypox shot made my previous injection sites sore again? Is this a thing? I'm not sick or have any other side effects, I'm just curious if this has happened to anyone else. For reference, monkeypox vax went into the back of my arm  near my armpit since it needs to be in the subcutaneous layer, and my other two are in a normal spot. I don't plan on worrying or anything unless the soreness doesn't subside, but it is a bit annoying of a side effect.

"Should I need to take any vaccines from a mouse bite? I've been bitten by a house mouse three times now, two of which occurred within the past month. The first bite happened about a year ago, and the most recent two were in close succession. The second bite was a bit larger than the third, which happened just last night. I'm unsure if I need to get vaccinated for these bites. Each time, blood was drawn, but the pain only lasted a few minutes and only becomes noticeable when I think about it. After last night's bite, I immediately washed the wound with running water. While the wound is tiny and doesn't hurt much, I'm still concerned about whether I should seek medical attention or vaccinations.

"Question! Can someone help explain to me why it is so dangerous for unvaccinated kids to be in public schools, daycares, etc? Like who exactly are these rules intended to protect? Is it mostly to protect kids who might be unable to get vaccines for health reasons? Or is it because of the risk to other (by parents choice) unvaccinated kids? Or is an outbreak of something like measles still dangerous even to others who have been vaccinated against it? 

I see the argument a lot from anti-vaxxers like “how can my kid be a threat to yours if yours has been vaccinated and mine doesn’t have ___ sickness?” or “explain his exactly my kid spread a disease they don’t have?” And I always want to better understand the answer- I understand herd immunity generally speaking, but don’t *quite* understand who is at risk by allowing unvaccinated children into schools, etc. Is it just in their own (unvaccinated) kid’s interest and that’s why it’s required? Or does this somehow pose a threat to those who have had vaccines as well? 

I’ve always known that vaccines are super important, but struggle when answering those types of questions from those who feel otherwise...

"It's the Patriarchy... I can't believe I didn't see it sooner. CW: Sexual Abuse

I got biopsy results today and learned I do not have cervical cancer... I am so, so incredibly relieved and grateful. 

But I'm also angry. 

One of the reasons I delayed going to the gyno in the first place is because of sexual trauma and abuse from my past AND uncomfortable experiences with gynecologists. I recently had cystectomy and my surgeon KEPT CASUALLY PUTTING HIS HANDS ON MY LEGS/KNEES WHILE HE TALKED and I WASNT WEARING PANTS. My heart rate was at 175. I mean, *how the fuck is it acceptable for OBGYN's not to be trauma informed in 2023?*

HPV can lead to CANCER in women, and while men are carriers, the risks for men seem to be significantly lower. No one said shit to me about HPV when I was younger like, ""Hey, this STI can lead to CANCER!"" I would have remembered that. And I bet if men were at as much risk as women, I would have known more. 

Women aren't anesthetized for colposcopies --- I'm just trying to imagine someone coming to take a skin biopsy without any pain relief. But your cervix? Sure! Grab some of that, No problem! We can handle it. 

And don't even get me started on how long women have to SHOUT to have their pain taken seriously by doctors. Anyone on an endometriosis journey can attest. 

So to bring it full circle, I feel like I was walking around carrying *so much shame*  for potentially putting myself at risk for getting cervical cancer but really, if you zoom out, and look at the systems at play, it's the fucking patriarchy that's needs to be dismantled, not my self-esteem. It makes me so mad that I took all of that on.... and I just wanted to write about this revelation that I had today post-biopsy results incase anyone out there is feeling like I was... I didn't see a single article or post that said anything about sexual trauma and having horrible experiences at the gyno, and I fucking doom scrolled for over a month, taking this all on myself, reading over and over again how it's my job to prevent this shit, and my job alone which is total bullshit.

"My real feelings about attacking all anti vaxers. Listen here's the thing, everyone here needs to understand that vaccinating a child can differ for people. It's just a medical reason that you can't take a vaccine or else you will die from it, it's also if your child is home schooled because there behavior is ""different"" then others.  I know that these kids will still go outside but not every day to a place filled with other kids. I know it's dangerous for kids to not be vaccinated but it's not the same danger level for everyone. The bigger picture is the myth that they lead to autism. Listen, when there is a HUGE FUCKING SOCIAL STIGMA against autism then maybe parents don't want to risk it if they think there child will be healthy enough without a vaccine.  I mean when so many jokes online and in person are just ""Lol Autism"" ""SPERG!"" ""Weaponized Autism"" ""He/She have autism because of blank"" and that programs to help with autism can be very low in certain areas plus even if there are many it still costs LOTS OF MONEY to use them then yeah they have a point. Like they don't want to have to deal with their kids being bullied because they cant control them being different and it's still the big target for bullying.

"CKC six month follow up - good news! I just got my results back from my six month follow up pap following a CKC for AIS and got good news! It was my first normal pap in nearly seven years. I had two tests done, a regular pap test and then another higher up in the cervix because I showed evidence of skip lesions based on my surgery pathology.

I also tested negative for high risk HPV which is a HUGE win for me! Post surgery, I took indole-3-carbinol and a multi-vitamin, drank a lot of green tea and chamomile tea, and tried to eat as many fruits and veggies as I could.

Sometime between needing a LEEP and my CKC, I started getting the HPV vaccine.

Months later I went down the rabbit hole and I'm seeing all the fucked up shit that's been happening. I want it out of my body but I can't take it back. I was too late to learn. I guess I'm gonna resist the bonuses for booster shots in the future, for one thing. Any advice?

Now today, I am already thinking I am not gonna make it, due to all the cancers associated with it. Even if two bumps on my groin is extra skin and non cancerous, I can tolerate that. But after 19 months if I see them popup, then what if I have other High strains, and eventually down the line I'll get cancers. Wouldn't GW appearing 19 months later means that my immunity failed to suppress and the strains won?

Then again, I wouldn't want anyone to be hurt by me. Therefore, wouldn't I be able to see my brothers, hug my mother, and have kids down the line? Had suicidal thoughts. I come from a pretty conservative family. I repented ever since the incidence. Is there anyway to get rid of this disease forever?

"Stupidity on the newborn unit. I just came out of a newborn exam with a new understanding of the level of obtuseness and stupidity that surrounds us.  Here are a few of the highlights.  Mom presents to maternity in labor (after getting marginal pre-natal care elsewhere, so we don't have records), and presents an extensive 'legal birth plan' outlining her desire for a natural 'lotus' birth.  The birth plan is mainly printouts of various conspiracy quasi-medical websites offering distinctly non-rational arguments against almost everything we do in newborn care.  She and partner are Covid vaccine refusers, and they refuse Covid testing on admission, so we are stuck with full PPE and have to put her in one of our scarce isolation rooms.   After delivery, she refuses to allow us to weigh the baby (eventually she changed her mind).  She refuses HepB vaccination.  She refuses erythromcyin ointment ophthalmic prophylaxis.  She refuses Vitamin K administration.  She didn't get eval for gestation diabetes while pregnant so we don't know if baby is at risk for hypoglycemia, but she refuses chemstrips.  I don my full PPE to examine the baby and have a discussion hoping I can educate them regarding risks and benefits to all these refusals.  I go through my spiel, trying to be calm and measured and factual, and they keep pushing the long 'legal birth plan' document at me, and I keep trying to refute the lies and inaccuracies and distortions that they believe, and make zero progress.  And all the while, since this was an intended 'lotus delivery' (and they intend to keep the decaying placenta attached to the baby until the cord separates), the baby is lying in its bassinet next to a dead placenta.  Fortunately the baby had a normal exam, but something tells me that keeping a dead organ attached after birth is a perfect setup for sepsis, omphalitis, and a prolonged stay in the NICU.  These people seem outwardly to reasonable and rational; they listen to what I present, ask some questions which I answer to the best of my ability, and then say they will consider what I've said, and then go ahead and sign the hospital required waiver acknowledging that they have been advised of the risks of forgoing standard practice care and basically continue to refuse virtually all aspects of care.  I've had to deal with anti-vaxxers in Peds for a long time, but this level of ""I've done my own research"" and I don't value your years of training and experience and refuse to take your advice -- is a new level of just wanton stupidity.  It's my job to try to help people understand complex medical issues and make informed decisions, and usually I'm good at that, but this just confuses the hell out of me, particularly when they are making these decisions not for themselves, but for their children, and placing those children at a level of unnecessary risk.

"20 Questions for vaccine proponents  

1. If we don't know what causes autism how do we know that vaccines don't cause it?
2. How did we determine that vaccines don't cause autism?
3. How many unvaccinated children did they look at to determine that vaccines are safe?
4. How many orphans were used to make sure vaccines are safe? Did they use a large enough number?
5. Why do scientists expect to find health differences in groups of children that receive an equal number of vaccines?
6. If  vaccines are so safe why do people feel it was unethical to test them  on mentally handicapped individuals? Didn't they benefit from the shots?
7. How does one fraudulent doctor make all vaccines safe?
8. Does that mean we should have more fraudulent doctors so that vaccines can be even safer?
9. They  teach medical students ""Half of everything we teach you is wrong"" and  then ""We know that vaccines are very safe"". Does that mean there is a  50% chance that vaccines are less safe than previously thought?
10. Why is everything the WHO and the CDC say true?
11. Are there statistics not sponsored by the CDC that show 100% of what the WHO says is correct?
12. Why is the absence of the smallpox virus evidence of influenza vaccine safety?
13. What percentage of neonates share needles?
14. Why did studies find vaccination is associated with decreased autism risk?
15. Does that mean vaccines protect against autism?
16. Does that mean we aren't vaccinating enough if there are still many children with autism?
17. Why  is a non-randomized study that finds vaccine cause harm not evidence of  non-safety because it's not randomized but and non-randomized study  that shows vaccines to be safe is evidence of safety?
18. What language does the immune system use and what language do adjuvants speak? Do adjuvants ever stop talking?
19. Does  the immune system understand that it should produce antibodies against  the antigen but not the other ingredients in the vaccine?
20. What is the biological mechanism by which vaccines caused the government to pay out billions to victims of vaccine injury?

$VXRT Vaxart: Implied upside of 140% (From the Motley Fool 4/27/2021)

There are close to 2,000 small-cap stocks and securities for investors to choose from. However, Wall Street professionals believe you'll have a hard time topping the potential 140% return over the next year from clinical-stage biotech stock Vaxart (NASDAQ:VXRT).

The Vaxart rags-to-riches story will come down to how well the company's coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment option, VXA-CoV2-1, fares in clinical studies. What makes this treatment so unique is that it's a tablet, rather than a shot, which could play a key role in overcoming vaccine resistance and administration. After all, you don't need trained medical personnel to administer to a tablet.

At the beginning of February, Vaxart announced a positive first step for VXA-CoV2-1 in a phase 1 trial. Preliminary data showed it had reached all of its primary and secondary safety and immunogenicity endpoints."	0
How many times do I need the HPV vaccine I recently visited the doctor and was told that I’m up to date on all my vaccines except for the HPV vaccine. However, I know for sure that I completed the full series of shots two years ago, and I even received a couple of doses a few years before that. The doctor said they had no record of it, so I was given the vaccine again.

"This is NOT your fault Contracting HPV is not your fault and you need to stop dumping on yourself. I posted this as a response to another in the community but I feel like it's not stressed enough:

I want you all to know this is a very common std to get and we shouldn't be ashamed of ourselves or feel the need to disclose the number of sexual partners we've had, I love and support you if you've had 0 sex partners or 1000+ , this is not your fault and sex is an awesome beautiful natural thing we shouldn't be ashamed of having or enjoying.

Sex is not a shameful thing you don't have to defend your sexual history or tell me the # of people you slept with, it's irrelevant. You can get HPV from one single sexual encounter.

Hello again I posted before days about hpv and feel guilty about may transmited hpv to my sister or mother because for 3 years i have anal warts and don't know it is hpv and use everything with them , my sponge shower (loofah) is very close and touch my sister's sponge always i was scratched the warts with my sponge (or may one day used mine by mistake) , before month i just said i will be ok if i can check my anal for cancer each 2 years to get rest of mind , and when i went to doctor and told me there is just one wart and all thing is fine (because visit doctor and know u  r gay is dulifficult in my homophobic country ), then after this my ocd drive me to may i infected my family in the past (i don't know is that really ocd or i have realto fear) , anyway im in the worst part in my life even worst fr the time that i knew i have hpv , this is the first time in my life to thinking series about suicide !!

"What explains the cases where healthy babies, after getting vaccinated, developed autism? To disprove antivax, people always cite how the original autism MMR study was fraudulent and newer studies finding no links, so i always thought antivaxxers were convinced from the original study and propoganda only, not really personal experience. 

Until I met this guy at a wedding last week, his son sitting at the same table had autism. The guy said that he was a happy normal healthy baby, until he got the MMR vaccine, which gave him a bad fever, and then after he was never the same, always quite and off, later diagnosed with some form of autism. Surprisingly he didn't even know about the anti vax movement. 

So is there anything that explains these cases? I know there are diseases where people lack the enzymes to break down toxins produced in their body, so they have to avoid certain foods, or else the neurotoxins can accumulate and cause adverse effects, especially during development. Maybe theres something we missed?"	1
"Why can't inoculation be used for Covid-19 instead of a vaccine? In the old days they would powder down the disease in a less potent form and give it to people so they would become immune to it. 

This used to work - If this is the case why can't this be implemented instead trying to find a vaccine?

The only apparent downfall is that this used to have a 2% death rate, but in this day and age because medical care has advanced since this then would this still be the case."	0

Why don't vaccines have double-blind testing? An anti-vax friend pointed out that vaccines get approved without double-blind testing with placebo controls.  I know that medicines need this for FDA approval, why not vaccines?  I didn't have a good response.  I am skeptical AF, and that is what we always demand as the required proof if someone wants to show that homeopathy or acupuncture works.  So why isn't it used for vaccines?	1

I’m incredibly livid about it. I have my vaccinations and am clean, but feel dirty despite it. I want to confront him about this, but I don’t know how to go about it. Is it even worth it? And if so, how do I initiative and navigate this conversation?"	1
"BLACK PEOPLE ARE NOT VACCINE HESITATE It's really been bugging the absolute shit out of me that [this lie of  Black Americans](https://www.businessinsider.com/snl-backlash-stereotypes-black-people-covid-19-vaccines-2021-4) as a demographic are resistant to getting the vaccine is being spread. No, no they are [not](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fewer-black-americans-are-getting-the-covid-19-vaccine-no-its-not-hesitancy/).

From: FiveThirtyEight

>The early data we have on vaccination rates is incomplete, but one fact is particularly alarming: [Black Americans are getting vaccinated at a much slower rate](https://khn.org/news/article/as-vaccine-rollout-expands-black-americans-still-left-behind/) than their white counterparts. This is troubling given [how hard the pandemic has hit Black Americans](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-why-african-americans-vulnerable-covid-19-health-race).  
>  
>But it’s also concerning because people often misunderstand why the rate is lower. Many are quick to point to [a distrust of the medical community](https://time.com/5925074/black-americans-covid-19-vaccine-distrust/), as Black people do have [a long history](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/racism-discrimination-health-care-providers-patients-2017011611015) of being [ignored](https://www.today.com/health/implicit-bias-medicine-how-it-hurts-black-women-t187866) or actively mistreated by health care professionals in the U.S. — most notably, in the infamous 40-year-long [Tuskegee study](https://www.kqed.org/news/11861810/no-the-tuskegee-study-is-not-the-top-reason-some-black-americans-question-the-covid-19-vaccine), which denied Black men treatment for syphilis so researchers could track the natural progression of the disease. But a recent [Pew survey](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/03/05/growing-share-of-americans-say-they-plan-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-or-already-have/) challenges the idea that Black Americans are hesitant to get vaccinated: A majority of Black adults (61 percent) told Pew that they either planned to get a COVID-19 vaccine or have already gotten one, a sharp uptick from the 42 percent who said in November that they planned to get vaccinated.  
>  
>And this reflects what health experts have told me about this issue. They don’t really think distrust of the vaccine explains the large gaps we’re seeing in vaccination rates. What’s more, blaming the gap wholly on distrust is dangerous because it puts the onus on Black Americans around vaccinations and distracts us from the real reasons why the inoculation rate is lower. “The experience of Black Americans within the U.S. health care system has been extremely troubled to say the least,” said Sean Dickson, the director of health policy at the West Health Policy Center. “But we don’t want to rely on the narrative that Black people aren’t willing to get the vaccine,” he said, adding that he thought the real issue was the lack of investment in vaccine distribution in Black communities.

Many Black Americans simply don't have access to the [vaccine](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/us-blacks-latinos-remain-covid-19-vaccine-deliberate/story?id=79830353). This seems to be a hard  concept for many to fathom. But, its lack of [education & access](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/04/26/989962041/why-black-and-latino-people-still-lag-on-covid-vaccines-and-how-to-fix-it) that is keeping Black Americans from receiving the vaccine.

From: NPR

>These vaccine inequities are [reflected across the country](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/latest-data-on-covid-19-vaccinations-race-ethnicity/), where Black and Latino people consistently receive a smaller share of vaccine doses than they represent in overall population, COVID-19 cases and deaths.  
>  
>In Florida, for instance, Black people represent 16% of residents but only 8% of those vaccinated. In Illinois, 17% of people who died from COVID-19 were Black, but only 9% of those vaccinated are. In Arizona, 14% of vaccinations have gone to Hispanic people, while they account for more than twice that share of COVID-19 deaths and state population.  
>  
>While overall vaccination rates in Philadelphia are beginning to slow in the last couple of weeks, providers there — and echoed nationally — say the disparity between racial groups isn't the result of people who are hesitant to get vaccinated. Instead, they say barriers such as the location of vaccination sites, online-only sign-ups, appointment scheduling, transportation and other planning and access issues are to blame.  
>  
>To address this, Philadelphia is making efforts to set up vaccine clinics in the communities with the lowest vaccination rates — which are also some of the communities of color hit hardest by COVID-19 — and to make appointment scheduling more flexible."	1

"Party vs meningitis 18f 

Hi,
I was invited to a party that is in like a week and I would happily go but I have one problem. The party would consist only of people in my class. My whole class excluding me is vaccinated for meningitis. I was not able to get the vaccine as I have anxiety and was sick. I will be getting it in a month or two, but I am afraid of getting meningitis. There has never been a case of meningitis in my small town btw if that’s important. 

I just don’t know ifI should go or stay at home, could someone educate me on the topic of meningitis? :)"	0
"Just got 2nd dose of MMR after a long journey of dead ends, lack of records and cagey family members.  So, there are now 9 cases of measles in Ireland. I got my second dose of the MMR just over an hour ago. Arm hurts a tiny bit but that’s it. But it has been a hell of a journey. 

I have been told that I did receive the first dose of this vaccine as a baby but due to a bad reaction, I didn’t receive the second dose. To this day, I do not know how bad the reaction was or when this reaction happened. My parents have been very tight lipped on it, especially my mother. 

When cases here started rising, I decided to look into getting a second dose, as I work in a university and live with immunocompromised people. I contacted my old and current GP to see if I could get a record of my first appointment. Nothing. My current GP wouldn’t even see me to discuss getting a second dose. I did manage to get some records from our health services, but again, there was nothing there. 

When asking my parents, my mother told me that after getting the first dose, I stopped meeting milestones, they were told I was slow and not developing properly and had to go to speech therapy. She blames the vaccine for it, because it was soon after I got the vaccine that this happened.  And again, she still didn’t tell me exactly what happened, just that I got really sick. 

Eventually, I got a second opinion from another doctor. He told me that considering that I have had multiple covid and flu vaccines, as well as 2 doses of the HPV vaccine last year with no side effects, that I should be fine. So I got it today after work. I was in and out in half an hour and I’m not dead. 

My mother is not happy about this but I don’t really blame her. I was vaccinated against everything else, it was only this booster I didn’t get.  The doctor told me yesterday that the MMR never caused a developmental delay but she doesn’t believe him. I wonder if I just got particularly bad side effects. 

Well, we will see what happens.  I was told by the vaccinator that this vaccine is very safe and effective. Wonder what side effects I’ll get. "	0

"For people with STD Anxiety I have recently received my test results for HIV, Syphilis and HbSag and guess what? ALL NEGATIVE. This is 6 weeks post exposure with blood from vein tests and all of them turned out conclusively negative. 

I was a mess during those 6 weeks of hell. I lost interest in everything I liked and moped around making my friends and family notice. You gotta ask yourself, are you scared of an std or is this your guilty conscience making you feel like it?
My sex was protected so there really wasnt a real risk but I ignored all of that because the guilt clouded my mind.

First of all, if your sex was protected, I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH... YOU ARE SAFE!!!
I ignored all logic! I had no reason to believe that the SW I did it with was HIV+ and my sex was protected but all logic out the window!

You need to assess your real risk and figure out if you are fighting a real issue or a mental issue.
I had symptoms that pointed towards an std like swollen lymph nodes, constant headaches and pins and needles around the body but seeing my 6 weeks conclusive test, they are something non-std related. Anxiety can cause these symptoms and trust me, you will find bumps in your body if you constantly look for them. Calm the fuck down about stds and don't spend your time on Reddit! No one on Reddit will convince you that you do not have an std if you dont believe it yourself.

You literally CANNOT get HIV, Gono, Chlam and possibly Syphilis too if you used a condom! If you used a condom, the worse you can get is Herpes and HPV. So if you used a condom, stop thinking of HIV. You had no real exposure if you used a condom and I did not realize this before.

For people who did not get symptoms and used a condom, no you are not that 0.1% that was asymptomatic and negative on tests... you just dont have what you have. No one can convince you if you dont believe it yourself.
You are not that special that you will be that statistical anomaly that tests positive 1 year later NO. Late seroconversion is a myth and if you were experiencing symptoms but tested negative, investigate other health issues. If you had symptoms, your tests would be blinking red because your body is making antibodies to fight the bodies, getting symptoms would turn you positive sooner, not later. 

For people who did NOT use condoms, use logic and think positively! Do you have any reason to believe she/he had something? You could be wasting your time for nothing if you dont even have any reason to believe she/he had something so just test it. Stop basing on symptoms as all stds share the same symptoms and only a test would tell you what you do/dont have.

Testing for tests are:

HIV - conclusive at 6 weeks with 4th gen (no doctor has seen someone turn positive at 6 weeks with a negative at 4 weeks)
       -  60 days for rapid and retest at 90
Gono - 2 weeks 
Chlam - 2 weeks
Syphilis - 6 weeks with no chancre is conclusive


Wish you all luck and peace of mind.

"“Anti-vaxxer” here, Please don’t attack me. Serious discussions only. Firstly I’d like to say I’m not completely anti-vaxx. Me and my twin sister had febrile seizures and were hospitalized from the MMR and DTAP vaccines as kids, and ever since I’ve been skeptical of them. 

Personally, I believe that vaccines are dangerous, but somewhat effective (not nearly as effective as everyone thinks, but I believe they work somewhat.) I would vaccinate if they were safe. 

Here’s why I think they are dangerous: 

All you have to do is look up each vaccine, their ingredients, their side effects, and how much of it is allowed in order to be safe according to the FDA. 

Okay, so let’s take an ingredient, Aluminium for example.  The FDA says “premature [newborns], who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 [micro]g/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity.” You can find that here: 

https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=201.323

But the average newborn weighs approximately 7.5lbs or 3.5kg. 
The “Safe limit” is = 5 micrograms/kg/day
Multiply by weight of newborn: (5mcg/kg/day)(3.5kg) = 17.5 micrograms/day.

The Amount of aluminum in the hepatitis B vaccine, given on the first day of life is 250 micrograms. 

That’s over 14x over the ‘safe limit’. And that means it most definitely causes brain damage, bone toxicity, and can be deadly.  

You can do this for each weight, and for each ingredient, and see that it just gets worse and worse. 

I’d just like to know anyone’s thoughts on this and if I’m right or wrong, but please be kind about it and be factual, and proof for all of your claims as in I want to see the actual studies or science behind it.

"Discussion! What does everyone think. I don't want to be labeled as an anti-vaxxer, but I have some questions and concerns about vaccines [discussion]

Hey r/conspiracy, I wanted to start a discussion about vaccines. I know this is a touchy topic, and the front page of reddit is very harsh on anybody who questions the validity of vaccines in any way.

I love and believe in science, and my interest in this topic comes only from a place of genuine concern, and trying to earnestly figure out what would be the best thing to do for my future children. I grew up extremely pro-vaccines, but the internet has exposed me to some information that seems like an important part of the discussion.

So I'm laying out some of the information I've seen, and the points they bring up. A lot of this information was collected from other reddit posts (including [this great post](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/aw1dqm/assumptions_i_had_when_i_was_a_provaxxer/) and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/b10ywn/reddits_247_provaccine_circlejerk_isnt_it/eiixxmk/) also) but I've added a few links of my own, and re-arranged some of the information to make it easier to digest.

By re-posting it again here, I'm hoping we can start a conversation about these points. If anybody has any important points they want to include, comment and I'll edit it in. If there is any misinformation mixed in, please help point it out and I'll update the original post with the best info possible. Hopefully we'll all be better informed at the end of this!

**So I want to start off by looking at this Wikipedia article:** [**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical\_human\_experimentation\_in\_the\_United\_States**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States)

Just to remind everybody that, when it comes to the US government's, we are dealing with a convicted criminal who has a history of using these types of tactics for unethical ends, by unethical means:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;[**Unethical human experimentation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation) **in the United States** describes numerous experiments performed on human test subjects in the United States that have been considered [unethical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ethics), and were often performed illegally, without the knowledge, [consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent), or [informed consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent) of the [test subjects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_subject_research). Such tests have occurred throughout American history, but particularly in the 20th century. The experiments include: the exposure of humans to many chemical and biological weapons (including infection with deadly or debilitating diseases), [human radiation experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_radiation_experiments), **injection of toxic and radioactive chemicals**, surgical experiments, interrogation and [torture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture_and_the_United_States) experiments, tests involving mind-altering substances, and a wide variety of others. **Many of these tests were performed on children,**[**\[1\]**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States#cite_note-Against_Their_Will:_The_Secret_History_of_Medical_Experimentation_on_Children_in_Cold_War_America-1) the sick, and mentally disabled individuals, **often under the guise of ""medical treatment"".** In many of the studies, a large portion of the subjects were poor, racial minorities, or prisoners.

&amp;#x200B;

With that said, vaccines get a lot of credit for saving millions lives by killing off major diseases including measles, mumps, whooping cough, etc.

**However, the evidence indicates that 90 percent of those diseases were wiped out by the popularization of sanitation, before the vaccines were developed.**

&gt;*“Although the committee is optimistic that more can and will be known about vaccine safety in the future, the limitations of the currently available peer-reviewed data meant that, more often not, we did not have sufficient scientific information to conclude whether a particular vaccine caused a specific rare adverse event. Where the data were inadequate to reach a scientifically defensible conclusion about causation, the committee specifically chose not to say which way the evidence “leaned,” reasoning that such indications would violate our analytic framework.” - IOM*

**Unlike a nature measles infection, receiving measles vaccines does not create lifelong immunity, effects wane over time:**

&gt;*“When immunity wanes, vaccination has a far more limited impact on the average number of cases. While this observation has clear public-health implications, the dynamic consequences of the interaction between vaccination, waning immunity and boosting are far more striking. For high levels of vaccination (greater than 80%) and moderate levels of waning immunity (greater than 30 years), large-scale epidemic cycles can be induced.”*

No other developed country administers as many vaccine doses in the first two years of life.”*

DTP was associated with 5-fold higher mortality than being unvaccinated. No prospective study has shown beneficial survival effects of DTP.

It should be of concern that the effect of routine vaccinations on all-cause mortality was not tested in randomized trials.

&gt;*All currently available evidence suggests that DTP vaccine may kill more children from other causes than it saves from diphtheria, tetanus or pertussis.* Though a vaccine protects children against the target disease it may simultaneously increase susceptibility to unrelated infections.

"So, you're thinking of dating someone with HPV As some of you know, I've been attempting to date. Recently, I disclosed to someone, and I wished I had a handy resource I could point him to that could answer his questions in a succinct and non-scary way. 

Ta-da!

Hopefully this resource will be helpful for some of you when you're disclosing, or for those of you who have hurriedly Googled HPV and are seeking answers. My purpose here is not to persuade anyone to undertake sexual activity they're not comfortable with, or to say to people that they must or should date someone with HPV. But I did want to have something handy to refer to for people who want to make a decision.

Disclaimer: not a doctor, not a scientist. Open to correction.

**So, you're thinking of dating someone with HPV**

If your prospective partner just disclosed to you - woohoo! You found someone who is honest enough to tell you about their sexual health, which can be a scary and difficult thing. NOT EVERYONE WITH HPV WILL DISCLOSE. This is not always deliberate: many people with HPV will never even know they have it. That's because women are only routinely tested for high risk HPV (more on that later) after a certain age (e.g. 25 in the US or UK), men are not commonly tested at all for high risk HPV, and nobody is commonly tested for low risk HPV unless they have visible genital warts. So, a LOT of people are walking around with a high risk or low risk infection (symptomatic or asymptomatic) and simply don't know. Additionally, advice from the medical profession can be mixed, and many doctors advise patients not to disclose their HPV infection. The reasons for this are varied, but I won't dive into them now. Anyway, your partner has disclosed, so this post is here to help you learn a bit more about HPV and figure out the next steps. 

**The** r/hpv **sticky post gives a lot of very useful information.** It's a lot to take in, but it's one of the most comprehensive resources out there. I would recommend reading the FAQ in full if you need further information. I will try to condense some of the most important parts here for you to make it easier to digest. 

The first and most basic thing to know is that HPV is a group of viruses that infect the skin. There are over 100 strains, and some of them prefer the genitals, and are passed on sexually. That's what we're focused on here.

**Step 1: Questions to ask your partner before you get down to making decisions:**

* Do they have high risk or low risk HPV? High risk HPV is the kind that is usually found when a cervical smear is co-tested. It doesn't usually cause any symptoms. Low risk HPV is the kind that usually causes genital warts (benign skin growths/bumps). Low risk HPV is usually diagnosed by sight, or occasionally by biopsy. 
* Is their infection still active? If they were diagnosed through a cervical smear, have they had a negative HPV test since then? If they had genital warts in the past, have they been treated? Have they had recurrences of their warts in the last six months, or was it a long time ago?
* Do they know the strain type of their HPV? (Not everyone will know this, and it can be hard to find out depending on where you are and what testing has been done)
* Were they previously vaccinated with Gardasil? If so, it's likely that the type they have is not covered by the vaccine (more on that later).

**Step 2: Understanding the prevalence of HPV**

HPV is an incredibly prevalent virus. [More than 80% of people](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6745688/) will get a form of genital HPV in their lifetime (and actually, the linked study suggests this will happen by age 45). So, if you've had other sexual partners in your life, there's a good chance you've already been exposed to HPV, and may have already had, or currently have, an infection. And if you are going to have partners in future, you'll probably be exposed again. This is not to say you must willingly expose yourself right now. But it's important to place your partner's disclosure into context. 

HPV is not rare. It's not weird. It's not a marker of someone being promiscuous, unsafe, or unhygienic. It's pretty much an unavoidable consequence of having skin contact with other humans. 

In the modern world, we are hyper aware of STIs. And HPV testing and awareness are quite recent phenomena. If you've never heard of HPV, don't feel bad, but know that many, many people you know, and probably you yourself, have had it. 

You could have it right now. So pause before judging your potential partner.

**Step 2: Understanding the nature of HPV and immune suppression**

I bet you Googled HPV right away and saw scary things saying 'HPV is incurable' or 'HPV is for life'. Maybe your prospective partner even told you that. 

HPV is 'incurable' in the sense that there are only treatments for the symptoms (warts or cell changes), but like most viral infections, the virus is eventually controlled by the body's own immune system in the vast majority of cases. Annoyingly, this takes a lot longer with HPV than it would with a cold or flu. But for most people, this will happen [between 6 and 24 months after infection](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/198/6/827/913963). [More than 90% will be suppressed within two years](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt05-hpv.html).

The science on HPV immune suppression is evolving. It now looks like there may be some fragments of virus left in the skin even after immune control. And it seems like some people don't fully control the infection, so [it can recur later in life](https://www.healthywomen.org/your-health/menopause-aging-well/hpv-and-menopause-are-we-ever-out-woods). That's only a small number, though (otherwise many more women would develop pre-cancers and cancer in their older age). So for most people, it's clinically considered as good as gone within that period of a few months to a couple of years. We don't say 'chickenpox is for life', although technically the virus remains in the body and in some people can reactivate as shingles. Similarly, it's not quite accurate to say 'HPV is for life'.

Once it's immune suppressed, it's unlikely to transmit to you. So a partner who is telling you about their HPV infection many years ago is not very likely to give you that strain of HPV. And if your partner has an active infection right now, it won't be that way forever. 

HPV is not the same as HSV/herpes, where some people can get regular 'outbreaks' for life. 

**Step 3: Understanding the risk to you**

In general with HPV, you need to be aware that [condoms mitigate but don't fully prevent HPV transmission](https://journals.lww.com/stdjournal/fulltext/2002/11000/do_condoms_prevent_genital_hpv_infection,_external.18.aspx). Also, unlike with HSV/herpes, there aren't antiviral drugs that can reduce transmission. So proceeding to give an infected partner oral sex, or to have genital to genital contact with them, even with condoms (and potentially dental dams), does pose some risk of transmission to you. 

Of course, you may have had their type of HPV already, especially if you've had an active sex life beforehand. In that case, you are unlikely to get reinfected with the same strain. 

But, if you do get infected, what's the outlook?

If your partner has low risk HPV (genital warts) and they have actual bumps present, they are highly contagious. Some sources give a [60% transmission rate](https://patient.info/doctor/anogenital-warts-pro). However, not everyone who gets low risk HPV will develop warts, as some people carry the virus asymptomatically. It's hard to say for you as an individual whether you would develop warts or not. The important thing to know about warts is that they are usually benign (90% of warts are caused by two strains, 6 and 11, which don't cause cancer). They can be annoying to remove and a lot of people feel distressed or depressed about having them. But they're not actually a health risk. 

If your partner has high risk HPV, there are some potential health risks to you. In most people, the immune system suppresses the virus and there aren't any health issues arising. But in some people, the virus persists and can cause cell changes that then become cancerous. [There are a variety of cancers caused by HPV](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-and-cancer). Most of these are pretty rare, and are not screened for. If you have a cervix, cervical cancer is the most prevalent risk, but attending your regular smear test is a good way to pick up persistent infections and get monitored and treated if necessary. If you don't have a cervix, oral cancer rates, especially for men, are rising. But unfortunately, [screening for oral HPV is not recommended](https://oralcancerfoundation.org/understanding/hpv/hpv-oral-cancer-facts/) as a way to prevent cancer. So there's not much you can do about it.

If you don't have a cervix, you will probably never know for sure if you have a high risk infection or not. And even if you do have a cervix, you have to be tested at the exact time you have HPV, which if you're on a three-yearly smear cycle (as is normal in my country), means you could well miss the infection if it doesn't last that long.

Bearing in mind that you probably will get high risk HPV of some sort, at some point in your life, if you have a few sexual partners, the risks are basically the same. But they are something to bear in mind and think about if your potential partner has an active high risk infection right now. 

**Step 4: Understanding the impact on your sex and love life**

One of the most stressful things about getting an HPV diagnosis is worrying about telling other people. Many of us here on this forum have felt gross, undesirable, unlovable etc. Disclosing is really freaking scary and rejection (or the fear of it) sucks. 

So yes, this is something to bear in mind if you are thinking about the risks of HPV. However, it is worth considering that you may not need or want to disclose forever. Disclosure is something of a grey area once you get past the point of having an active infection. Once you've got a negative high risk HPV test, or once you've gone for a decent length of time (probably 6 months +) with no wart regrowth, you may feel comfortable not disclosing to partners. Or, you may feel you want total transparency in case of recurrence. It's up to you. We also have many members of this forum who have disclosed to partners who have been fine with HPV. 

**Step 5: Understanding your options**

Obviously, one option is to say no to this potential partner and walk away. This is your prerogative, and you need to do what feels right and comfortable for you. As someone with HPV, I'd just ask that you do it gently. And remember that walking away this time doesn't mean you will never get HPV - so bookmark this reddit!

Option two is to seek vaccination if you haven't had it already. It may be available free in your country/healthcare system, or you may need to pay. It takes a few months to complete the course of three shots. Gardasil 9 covers the two strains that cause 90% of warts, plus 7 prevalent high risk strains. Even if things don't work out with this person, it can be a good thing to do, although bear in mind that if you're older/have had a lot of partners already, it might not be as effective as you've probably been exposed to some of the strains already. You also need to be aware that people can have types of HPV not covered by the vaccine. 

Option three is to proceed with a relationship but taking precautions until your partner tests negative, or until enough time has passed after warts that you feel comfortable - or until you are vaccinated. Using sex toys, or your hands, is fine, as long as you wash your hands before touching your own genitals, and don't share toys. You may feel comfortable receiving oral sex (bearing in mind that they could have a concurrent oral infection, but there's no way to know unless they have actual oral warts - but the same is true of anyone you meet). There are lots of other fun things you can do that are sexual or otherwise while you wait. 

Option four is to proceed with a full sexual relationship, accepting the risk of transmission, given the prevalence of HPV in the population and the likelihood that you've come across it before or will in future. Using condoms while an infection is active is still a good idea, because it can lower the viral load shared between you and therefore make immune suppression quicker.

**The TL;DR summary**

Nobody can define your personal comfort level and it's up to you whether you go ahead with sex and/or a relationship with someone with HPV. Think it through and weigh up how you feel. Given the prevalence of HPV, you've probably had or will have HPV at least once yourself. And the most likely outcome is that your body suppresses it in time. But there are some health and psychological risks to take into consideration."	1

Food is causing cancer. Not vaccines. Why do you think it is that one cigarette doesn’t give you cancer, but rather a lifetime of cigarette usage likely will? Would it not make sense that a lifetime of poor eating habits would cause cancer, rather than a vaccine you received once in your life? Or that consistent exposure to plastics since in the womb would lead to people developing cancer at a younger age? Why specifically are younger people developing colon cancer at higher rates and not lung cancer because of vapes or any other cancer like lymphoma or bone cancer due to vaccines? Colon cancer is specially linked to diet and the processed foods we put in our bodies. It is so prominent, it is recommended you get a colonoscopy at a certain age to check for it. This was recommended LONG before COVID. When you look at the rates of colon cancer diagnosis by country, the countries who consume the least amount of meat have the lowest rates of colon cancer diagnosis. That’s not nothing. 	0
Is there a way to remove a covid vaccine from your system? I am in no way suggesting an opinion either way about the vaccine, for it/against it, this is not the point of this post. I am simply curious if there has been any research done on or a method developed for removing a vaccine from your body after it has been injected? With so much controversy over the subject I'm just curious if anyone has tried to do it. (I read something about Epsom salt bathes or cupping but it seems obvious that wouldn't be effective. Also, I anticipate a lot flak for this post but please just re-read the first sentence)	0

"My Colposcopy Experience Hi y'all! I had a colposcopy and biopsy done at the beginning of February. I received my results from my annual pap smear in mid-January and they came back abnormal with the presence of HPV. Prior to the procedure, I was incredibly anxious because all of my previous pap smears had been normal, so I instantly feared the worst.

I also didn't have anyone in my personal life to ask about the procedure -- I am the only one of my family members and friends to have had this done. Something that really helped me was reading the personal stories of people on this sub and other subs/internet forums who had had a colposcopy and biopsy done. Doing so helped me to get a real, human sense of what the procedure might look like and how I might feel before, during, and after the procedure. This helped me way more than reading scientific articles and studies because it allowed me to envision what the day could look like for me. Now that I have my results back, I'm hoping to ""pay it forward"" by providing my experience with the procedure. Apologies in advance for the length of this post, but it really did help me to read other people's step by step experiences with the procedure, so hopefully it will do the same for anyone else going through this. 

Please keep in mind that this is my personal experience and, as such, is influenced by factors such as where I live (the United States), my pain tolerance, procedures at my gynecologist's office, resources available at my gynecologist's office, etc. I am open to questions, so feel free to ask (or PM if you do not want to ask publicly).

**Preparing for the Procedure**

Here is what my gynecologist told me regarding how to prepare for the procedure:

* Be sure to schedule the procedure for when you are not menstruating or for when your flow is very light.
* Do not use tampons, vaginal creams, or douche for 24 hours before the procedure.
* Do not have penetrative vaginal sex for 24 hours before the procedure.

**What to Bring and Wear**

I would definitely recommend wearing comfy clothes. I wore my favorite sweatshirt, comfy socks and sneakers, and some jogger sweatpants because I didn't want to wear anything too tight or restrictive after the procedure -- wearing loose pants wasn't a recommendation from my gynecologist; it was a personal choice. If you feel uncomfortable removing your pants or if being exposed in that way is triggering for you, you could also wear a long flowy skirt.

If you use pads during your menstrual cycle and have a brand that you like, I would recommend bringing one with you to the appointment. My gynecologist gave me some pads to take home after the procedure was over, but I am not sure if every office will have the resources to do so, so it might be best to bring your own just in case.

You may also want to bring your phone and headphones into the exam room. I was not aware that this was an option at time, but before starting, the nurse asked if I wanted to listen to music or play on my phone during the procedure. If you're not sure if your gynecologist will allow this and you think that this is something that would help you relax, I would recommend asking when you call to schedule the procedure.

Finally, I brought some Advil with me and took 2 while I was in the waiting room. I would recommend bringing an OTC painkiller of your choice and taking some \~30 minutes or so before your appointment.

**Before the Procedure**

After getting checked in at my gynecologist's office, I was taken to a room where the colposcope was set up. Before getting undressed, my gynecologist came in to walk me through the procedure and answer any questions that I had. The first thing she said to me was that having a colposcopy and biopsy procedure does not mean that I have cancer, or even pre-cancerous cells, which made me feel better.

She made sure to heavily emphasize that HPV is ***incredibly*** common and that most people aren't even aware that they are infected, so this is not something that you should feel embarrassed by. This also made me feel better -- I felt ""dirty"" and ashamed for having an HPV infection, and also afraid of any potential future implications of this infection. Finally, she noted that most HPV infections, even those that are high risk, will just clear themselves out and will likely be fully cleared or undetectable within 6 months.

She then walked me through what we would be doing today and asked if I was OK to have a nurse present in the room with us during the procedure. She did note that if she didn't see anything abnormal with the colposcope, then we would not be doing a biopsy, so just because you are having a colposcopy done, it doesn't necessarily mean that you will also be having a biopsy done. I can't speak for every gynecologist's office, but she explained that the procedure at this office is for the lab to note any sign of abnormality in a pap smear sample, even if it's just a few cells.

She then opened up the floor for questions. I asked the following: (1) when can I expect my biopsy results; (2) what will further treatment look like depending on the results of my biopsy; (3) what does this mean for my partner; (4) are there any steps that I can take to help my body clear out the HPV infection. The answers to most of these questions are addressed in the ""Results and Further Treatment"" section. As for question 3, my gynecologist let me know that there aren't really any routine ways to screen men for HPV infections that aren't presenting symptoms, but its most likely that any HPV infection that he may have will clear itself up. As far as I know, he hasn't been intimate with anyone else while we've been together (we've been together for almost 2 years), nor have I been intimate with anyone else, so I was a little confused as to how I got infected. She told me that HPV can lie dormant for a while, so there was a likely possibility that either I was infected from a previous sexual partner (and potentially passed it to him) or that he was infected from a previous sexual partner and passed it to me.

**During the Procedure**

My gynecologist then left the room and asked me to get undressed from the waist down. After undressing, I got up on the table and put my feet in the stirrups. It was exactly the same as how I would get ready for a pap smear. My gynecologist re-entered the room with a nurse once I was ready.

The nurse stood next to me the entire time. She asked if I would prefer to just be left alone during the procedure (meaning not talked to) or if I would like to talk to her to distract myself from what was going on. She also asked if I had brought any headphones with me so that I could listen to music on my phone.  I know the nurse that was with me in the room pretty well because she always assists during my pap smears, so we ended up just talking the whole time.

My gynecologist made sure to warn me before she did anything so that there were no surprises. She also narrated what she was doing as it was happening so that I had an idea of where we were in the procedure. If this is not something that your gynecologist usually does (mine does this even during pap smears), please feel empowered to ask them to do so. It definitely helped me to know what was about to happen so that I wasn't caught off guard with any surprise pinches, cramps, etc.

The room we were in did not have a screen, but I understand that some offices have a screen that projects what the colposcope is seeing. I'm not sure if having a screen would have made me feel better, but if you are the type of person who prefers to see what's going on inside of you (ex. using a mirror to see what's happening during a pap smear), I would recommend looking at the screen if that resource is available.

First, my gynecologist inserted a speculum -- the exact same kind that she uses for my pap smears. It felt no different from how a pap smear would begin. For me, having the speculum inserted is not painful or uncomfortable, so this did not bother me. I understand that it may be different for others.

Next, she used a little spray bottle to spray my cervix with a vinegar solution (NOT apple cider vinegar). This is done to highlight any suspicious or abnormal-looking areas; the solution will turn any suspicious areas white. My gynecologist did tell me that some people will experience a slight burning or tingling sensation when the vinegar solution is applied. I did not feel anything, and even asked if she had sprayed it yet; however, please keep in mind that you may have a different experience. Next, my gynecologist wheeled over the colposcope. It looks like a big pair of binoculars with a bright light attached to at the top. The colposcope will NOT be inserted into you at any point; mine was placed right up against the speculum so that it was barely touching it.

My gynecologist did see a small area of concern, so I did have to have a biopsy done. I had a punch biopsy done, which involves a small circular blade (kind of like a hole-puncher) to remove a sample. First, my gynecologist used the small circular blade to ""punch"" the area of concern. This part didn't really bother me at all; she counted down from 3 to let me know that she was about to do the ""punch."" I would liken the sensation to how a pap smear feels for me. It's definitely not a fun sensation, but it was not painful. Next, she used a set of long, thin forceps to remove the sample. She did let me know that some people will experience cramping when this is done. For me, this was the most uncomfortable part of the procedure. Once the sample was removed, I began cramping. The cramps were worse than menstrual cramps; however, I am on the pill so my periods are usually very light and involve very little cramping. The cramps were not debilitatingly painful, but I could definitely feel them and I felt a little uncomfortable.

My gynecologist also wanted to sample some cells from inside of my cervical canal. This was done using an endocervical brush, which looks like a mascara wand or a brush that you might use on your eyebrows. She inserted the endocervical brush and lightly brushed around the entrance to my cervical canal. The brush will not be inserted deeply into your cervical canal, just ever so slightly past the entrance. The brushing itself was not painful, but it did exacerbate my cramps.

After she was finished collecting samples, my gynecologist applied a liquid bandage to my cervix. This is not an actual bandage -- it's a solution that looks a lot like peanut butter. It helps to stop any excessive bleeding and protects your cervix while it heals from the biopsy. The application did not hurt and did not cause any burning, stinging, etc. The entire procedure from start to finish took around 10 minutes or so.

**After the Procedure**

My gynecologist and the nurse left the room and I put my sweatpants back on. Once I was dressed, my gynecologist came back to discuss aftercare. Here are some important things to remember:

* You may experience cramps for 1-2 days after your procedure. For me, my cramping was over by the next day. To help, I took Advil regularly and also used a heating pad once I got home. I would describe my cramps as moderate - I could definitely feel them and they felt uncomfortable, but I was still able to shower and get ready for bed without any major issues. I mostly just rested for the rest of the day because I wasn't feeling amazing, but when I woke up in the morning, they were gone.
* Use pads to catch any bleeding. You can also free bleed if you would like, but I had to work the day following my procedure and didn't want to ruin my suit pants. You should not use tampons, menstrual cups, or anything else that needs to be inserted into your vagina. I bled a decent bit throughout the rest of the day, and then very lightly for a few days following my procedure. By day 4 post-procedure, my bleeding had stopped entirely.
* I also experienced some slight soreness in my vagina from the speculum. This cleared up in about a day or so. Like my cramps, it didn't cause pain on a scale that disrupted my ability to work the following day, but it did cause some discomfort.
* If your gynecologist applied a liquid bandage, you might experience some weird discharge over the next couple of days as your cervix heals. This is completely normal and no cause for concern. I experienced two types of discharge. On days 1 and 2 post-procedure, I had dark brown/black discharge that looked exactly like coffee grounds. This is normal; the liquid bandage will turn deep brown or black when it interacts with blood. On days 3 and 4 post-procedure, I experienced discharge that looked like small pieces of brown gauze. This is also normal and is caused by the liquid bandage. On days 5 and 6, I experienced some lightly brown-tinged watery discharge, but by day 7, I was completely back to normal.
* Avoid heavy exercise for a few days after your procedure. I went golfing on day 3 post-procedure, and walking around the course caused me to bleed a little heavier, so I would steer clear of more rigorous forms of exercise.
* Avoid penetrative vaginal sex after your procedure. For me, I was advised to wait at least a week. However, this could change based on how many samples your gynecologist ends up taking.

**Results and Further Treatment**

I received my biopsy results a week after they were taken. My results were low-grade dysplasia. This means that the abnormalities in my cervical cells will most likely not lead to cancer in the future and that the HPV infection that caused these abnormalities will likely clear up on its own. I have to have a pap smear again in 6 months, but beyond that, no further treatment at this time.

For people who receive a different outcome, such as high-grade dysplasia, your gynecologist may recommend removing the cells because these cells may be precancerous or become precancerous if not treated. My gynecologist's office offers the loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP), during which an electrical current is run through a skinny wire loop; the ""loop"" is inserted into you and used to cut away the layer of abnormal tissue. The goal (I think) is to remove the abnormal tissue and allow healthy tissue to grow in its place. When I asked about further treatment before my colposcopy began, my gynecologist informed me that, should I need this procedure, they will put me under general anesthesia so that I wouldn't feel anything. Again, I'm not sure if this option is available at every office, but please ask about it if you do not tolerate pain well (this procedure can be painful) or would otherwise feel better being under while the procedure occurs. This is your body and your health and you have every right to advocate for yourself and what will make you feel most comfortable.

In terms of taking steps to help my body fight off the HPV infection, my gynecologist recommended the basics: staying hydrated, eating nutrient-dense meals, getting good sleep, and exercising regularly, even if it just means going for a 20 minute walk each day. She also recommended looking into a multivitamin, just to make sure that my body is getting what it needs.

I hope that this was helpful to someone out there; reading about people's real experiences, even the ones that differed from mine, helped me feel more calm leading up to my procedure and gave me a more hopeful outlook on HPV causing changes to my cervical cells.

I am very open to questions, so feel free to ask in the comments or PM me (I am over the age of 18) if you would prefer to ask privately. If you do ask questions, please note that I am not a medical professional in any way and my advice shouldn't be substituted for anything that your doctor may tell you."	0
"FDA may greenlight updated Covid-19 vaccines as soon as next week, sources say | CNN The US Food and Drug Administration is poised to sign off as soon as next week on updated Covid-19 vaccines targeting more recently circulating strains of the virus, according to two sources familiar with the matter, as the country experiences its largest summer wave in two years.

The agency is expected to greenlight updated mRNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech that target a strain of the virus called KP.2, said the sources, who declined to be named because the timing information isn’t public. It was unclear whether the agency simultaneously would authorize Novavax’s updated shot, which targets the JN.1 strain.

SAN ANSELMO, CALIFORNIA - MAY 02: A positive Covid-19 at home test is displayed on May 02, 2022 in San Anselmo, California. Covid cases are on the rise across most of the United States with an estimated 51 percent increase in cases over the past 14 days. (Photo Illustration by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)
The US is experiencing its largest summer Covid wave in at least two years
The move would be several weeks ahead of last year’s version of the vaccine, which got FDA signoff on September 11.


“Now is the time to get a dose with this surge,” Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told CNN.

Osterholm said on his podcast last week that he recently got a dose of last season’s vaccine in order to increase his immunity while the virus is circulating at such high levels and amid uncertainty around when new shots would become available.

He added that he’ll now wait to get the updated one in four months, the interval recommended by health officials.

In June, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that everyone over 6 months old receive both an updated Covid-19 vaccine and a flu shot this year.

Representatives for Pfizer and Moderna told CNN that the companies had ample supply of their updated Covid vaccines and would be ready to ship doses upon approval. Moderna’s spokesman said it expects the vaccine to be available in stores within days of FDA signoff.

Novavax’s vaccine is based on protein technology, which takes longer to manufacture than mRNA vaccines. The company’s executives told investors on a conference call last week that it anticipated that its updated vaccine would be arriving in warehouses this month and that it’s expected to be ready for distribution when authorized. A spokesperson for Novavax didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Friday."	0

"My doctor has far-right viewpoints I may not agree with. What to do? Today I saw a new specialist doctor who my primary physician referred me to. During the course of questions to understand my health history he asked me if I had been vaccinated against COVID-19. I said I had received the shot and maybe a couple of boosters. He then said I shouldn’t get anymore and that new information has come to light that they are harmful. He said they weren’t real vaccines after all and that they should have never been given to anyone under the age of 50.

Of course I was conflicted. On the one hand, this sounded a lot like right-wing crack pottery. On the other hand, this was a medical doctor who has been practicing for over 40 years.

At the end of the appointment I asked him where I could read more about these new findings about COVID vaccinations and he said to go to Epoch Times (which is a far-right news website). He said there are a couple of scientists he follows and said I’d have to figure that part out. This sounded to me a lot like “do your own research.”

As for me, I am not a COVID conspiracy theorist and I believe in science. I already left one doctor who refused to wear a face mask in the MIDDLE OF LOCKDOWN, I am not sure if I should do the same here.

Since this new doctor is only a specialist who would have no influence on my future vaccination decisions, and I will only be seeing him for a short time, should I stop seeing this doctor as well? How much should I trust a doctor who apparently doesn’t agree with the greater medical community?"	0
"My experience sharing HPV with the girl I was seeing. Should you tell your partner? Forgive my my grammer here. 

I wanted to share my experience to everyone scattering the internet about HPV. Should you tell your partner or the person you are dating once you discover if you have it? My answer is simple, its **no**. Why? Let me explain. 

For reference I am a 29 year old male who I would consider to be healthy. I work out usually 4-5times a week and still play sports. and am active, healthy, and pretty discipline with my diet.  

I recently found out I have HPV because I saw a couple of small bumps near my genital area. Went to the dermatologist and told me it was HPV. I secretly knew I might of had it in the past as I've had small minor warts on my fingers by my nails and had them burned off with cryotherapy, but never down below until very recently. At the same time I've met someone who I was seeing and was head over heels with. I saw this person as someone I very much would be happy marrying. During this time I've had my genital warts treated once with cryotherapy. Majority of them went away after the first treatment but a couple small stubborn ones stuck around. I knew I wanted to get them treated again so I'd eventually be in the clear like it never happened. However, during this time I was getting very close to the person I was seeing and knew the relationship would be getting physical so I toyed with the idea if I had the balls to tell the person I'm dating and do the right thing or do I try and hide it.

I ended up sharing the news with the person I was seeing and they are aware of HPV but I didn't feel they saw it the same as you do now that you have it. After endless research I believe most would agree it is ultimately harmless and is just a minor skin condition that's a nuisance. No pain or any kind of discomfort. The real damage is the stigma of knowing you now have an STD / STI and how it effects you mentally. I'd hope she would see it this way, but of  course she would not. I wished to do the right thing and tell the truth, but it'll ultimately came back to bite me in the ass and cost me everything. 

Sure I'm heartbroken so this is slightly bias, but I truly believe if I would of just hid it a bit longer, got it treated, things would be as if they never were. After all HPV is one of those things where it can lay dormant for several years. There's no real way to track when you first encounter it especially since it doesn't even need to be sexual to get. Plus there is a good chance a breakout will likely never happen to a person, we are just the unlucky ones. This is an unfavorable opinion but there are very few out there so I will be the bad guy and say the hard truth.

I've searched countless articles, shared stories, and many reddit pages which swayed my decision to ultimately share my biggest insecurity. Most of the experiences you see are very much positive and we all need that, but this is something I believe should be best kept to yourself unless specifically confronted about it. At that point play the dumb card and go through the process. You can say I'm a piece of shit for saying this and I'll take that, but the reality is my life would be very different if I just kept to myself and keep the status quote. Most won't say this because its indecent but the hard truth most aren't willing to accept the news of there partner having HPV. If I were you I would likely avoid sharing it at all cost if you can. I know both sides of the perspective because I was told the same by another that they had HPV and jumped ship so I know exactly how it goes and I don't blame her or anyone for walking away given the option. It just sucks when its you caught in the pickle. 

In the end if I could do it over I would **not** of shared I had HPV. 

  
For those that are wondering about how the treatment is going and my experience, I will share. Cryotherapy is the way to go. Imiquimod 5% slightly works on the very small bumps but you have to stay at it. I did it for a week and a half but ended up stopping because it was smearing on healthy skin and would make everything look like chaos down there. Rest assure it does clear up and goes back to normal once you stop treatment about a week after. Same thing with cryotherapy, it looks horrendous for about a week, but don't pick or poke and allow time to do the work and again it will clear up and you'll be good to go.  With cryotherapy for me, the skin stayed slightly discolored but I'm confident in time it will go back to normal but this could take months before that happens. 

Also do both the Cryotherapy & the Cream together at the **same** time. Don't start the cream until two days after cryo treatment but its best to do both to help speed up the process and has been the most effective for me.  I've done my 2nd cryo treatment with the cream and everything is pretty much cleared up. I might possibly go back for a 3rd treatment to really nip this in the butt, but hoping the cream should clear out the couple little ones that were missed. Also YES more tiny warts can and did pop up once the treatment started but they will go away just as fast as they came. I don't think anyone will ever need more than 3 cryotherapy treatments, if you do then you are just really unlucky. I'd recommend to go back immediately as soon as your healed so 2-3 weeks recovery then more cryotherapy, any longer is just stale time. 

Definitely get them treated. Dont hold out thinking there going to go away on there own, they likely wont. Also refrain from any sexual endeavors, even self play. Otherwise your just prolonging your treatment and will likely spread and grow. Once there gone your in the clear.  

PS Dont hate me but its an honest review and I dont even know if this post will stay up but this effected me enough I wanted to share and get my prospective out there. I hope it helps for better or worse.

"Preparing for LEEP Procedure Hi friends. I started my period in December around Christmas and I have been bleeding nonstop for over one month, while taking my birth control. In addition to this, I started passing LARGE sized clots (like a few inches, spilling over the sides of my pad). No pain thankfully, just very inconvenient. After (finally) talking with my mom about it, she urged me to get an ultrasound and to go see an OBGYN. Yes, I know one month of bleeding is insane, but I am a full time college student (who is also working an internship in computational research) so my schedule is packed, fast paced and stressful. ?? 

I had an ultrasound about one week ago. It came up normal aside from slight cervical thickness. I went to see an OBGYN on Monday. She confirmed my cervix looked a bit off and said it looked like the blood was primarily coming from my cervix, not my uterus. She suggested a biopsy to make sure no weird shit was brewing. 

The biopsy was horrible. My doctor was fast and really apologetic but my god, y’all… WHY AREN’T WOMEN NUMBED???? Insane. Anyway.. 

I spoke with my doctor about the biopsy results and bloodwork. My bloodwork looked normal aside from high hemoglobin and low iron (indicators I’ve been bleeding a lot). The pap came up inconclusive because I was bleeding too much and they didn’t gather enough cells. HPV came up negative. My biopsy was completely clear. Ok, so, good news right? Well, I spoke with my mom, grandma and even my 2nd cousin who I’m close with over the weekend and they literally ALL CONFIRMED that cervical cancer runs rampant through our family history. Literally everyone has had a scare, hysterectomies because of precancer, etc. My cousin even had a LEEP procedure in her 20’s! I had no idea about this. Which makes me wonder what other family history am I just completely unaware of?!?? My doctor said she spoke with a few of her colleagues who work in oncology and they all agreed a LEEP procedure would be a good call, just in case the biopsy missed something. 

Fast forward to today. I’m nervous. I’m stressed. I’m in the middle of my winter quarter with an insane amount of responsibilities and shit on my plate. But I’m not dumb. I do not feel comfortable just ignoring one month of bleeding + clots.

Can anyone share experiences with LEEP? Maybe experiences with bleeding for a long time? I am 36 years old and happily married. I am very healthy and active. We are planning to have kids in around 2 years when I’m done with school. 

Thanks in advance if you read all of this and/or if you share any advice or experiences. ????"	0
$vxrt Oral Vaccine Focused Penny Stock Vaxart Is 'Uniquely Positioned', Analyst Sees Almost 83% Upside https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oral-vaccine-focused-penny-stock-175740934.html	0
"People are too worried about potential bloodclot and increased risk of heart attacks from the mrna vaccine... well some also mention the potential of weaker immune system or even aids from the mrna vaccine.

but look at the bigger picture here, a heart attack or stroke would be more of an individual problem, that it would not affect others other than more tax money spent on such cases.

with weaker immune system or immunocompromised being majority of a society, the whole society is more prone to infections by all sorts of virus and illnesses, previously weak virus would be able to inflict severe infections, this means the mrna vaccine would act like a trojan horse so not just covid but any illness can easily infect the hosts, and transmit the virus/illness to others, this also puts more risks to the healthy unvaxxed group as there are more virus of all sorts being released to the environment and putting more load on our healthy immune system.

the vaxxed majority would be walking virus factories of all sorts. the only way to solve this issue is to vaccinate them for all virus known to human even for the what was once weak and harmless ones. itd be like majority society have aids. 

this would be a serious issue for humanity as it is no longer just a lethal flu but anything goes. we might really need full ppe just to protect individuals, not just masks and faceshields."	1

"Sex after cancer Does anyone know if sex after cervical cancer is risky? I mean can my husband and I keep passing the HPV virus back and forth?

Also, can HPV go away after the cancer has been removed?

"Biopsy results ready but no word from Dr yet.. So, I could be acting silly and anxious but maybe one of you lovely people can tell me your experiences with how quickly you heard from your drs after biopsy results came in? Did you instigate an appointment or hear straight back?

 My biopsy results are sitting there today (they are on ‘my health record’, which is the Australian equivalent of mychart). They are locked, so I can’t read the results… do you think if it was big news that the Dr would call me or just wait for the next appointment (which we pre booked for next week?). 

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Did you get a message right away or did you have to wait or be proactive?

I might be being silly but I am a little worried as my gynecologist was concerned. In fact it wasn’t even supposed to be a colpo- just a pap- but she found something “a little concerning” and took multiple biopsies. 
I also had an TV ultrasound which showed cysts and a “mass” (which is not a great word!).  I will add that my last pap was not positive for HPV but was 5 years ago. "	0

I pushed back a bit, at first just asking politely that they reconsider and then (after being shot down immediately) Suggesting that their fears don't seem to line up with reality.

So far they've used supposed anecdotes to justify their mistrust of all doctors and to argue that all vaccines cause heart problems.

They have since threatened very drastic things (the sort that requires euphemisms on some social networks) and I do not want to lose this person.

"Update: My (25M) Significant Other (22F) Contracted HPV, Did She Cheat? So i laid out all the facts last time, and a lot of people were harassing me over me even possibly considering that a WomEN could cheat, and had people pointing out ""YTA"" and a bunch of armchair psychologists calling me a bunch of names for having my doubts about how my Fiance contracted HPV.   


Welp. Last week i swallowed my pride and accepted that i may have been the reason she gotten it. Tho i asked her to get tested for STD's to be safe to see if i gave her anything else. I also got tested.   


She tested positive for HSV1 + HSV2. On two tests.   


I tested negative for both.   


So she all the sudden has HPV, HSV1, & HSV2. Last time i flew her out was \~4 months ago.   


For anyone else who sees this in the future, trust your gut. if you have a bunch of armchair psychologists harassing you, ignore them. Don't fear asking for help, and always trust your gut. I've had over 10 STD tests in the last 5 years (2x a year, bec it's free and doctor insists). All negative. She had 2 confirm it's not a false positive, and had both show Positive for:   


HPV  
Oral Herpes  
Genital Herpes  


  
I currently do not have the bandwith to handle this. I'm bottling this inside. Just broke up with her. Absolutely fucking devastated. My Life is upside down. I cannot break down right now, i have a lot of important work stuff going on. Just need to continue and let myself feel all these emotions and process it at a later time. Right now I'm stone cold. To say that i feel emasculated is an understatement. To all those who insisted on derailing my initial threads, and harassing me in DM's, i hope you genuinely never feel this kind of pain in your life, but i do hope you get some kind of negative karma."	0
"Help on identifying Anti-Vax Site Legitimacy and Cherry picking tactics I wanted to post a link here: [www.justtheinserts.com](https://www.justtheinserts.com), that a dear loved one is using to buttress as evidence for dangers of vaccines. The website list details pretty much all the major ones and the ones running the site claim to be proponents of ""informed consent."" The red-flags I find here are:  


1. Its completely biased and purely anti-vaccine, they don't even take a centered approach.
2. The information is cherry picked from FDA, CDC, WHO, etc, and crops only what they want you to focus on, despite putting the source from where they cherry picked from.
3. Misleading engineered questions after each insert snippet, which can only be answered narrowly, being that the answer HAS TO BE negative instead of open-ended.
4. The information of who is running the site isn't present at all and we have no idea of who they are, what their educational background is and if their information is approved by a credible reviewer.
5. The site doesn't contain any actual raw informational text, every info doc is listed as a pdf which leads me to believe that, possibly they are avoiding web crawlers to fact check their information.
6. Anti-mask rhetoric and research, to fully round out the anti-science community's trifecta.
7. A merchandise shop to purchase your own ""informed-consent"" t-shirts on bonfire ??

My goal here in posting this is to:

* Bring more awareness to this site since its has been quietly circulating and the disinformation can be damaging like it has been with my relative, but more importantly....
* Discuss with the community here to dissect and understand how they are able to to make convincing, specious cherry-picking arguments while ""citing"" governmental health websites.

I learned that this site originally had a huge Instagram that was eventually taken down, but the website can be found on Google which is wild to me that it hasn't been removed. My guess being point number 5 above. I hope we can shed more light on this and truly do what my original reason for supporting vaccines, to not only protect myself but to protect others.

"Overview of cervical Cancer from WHO 2022 report- 660,000 cancer deaths per year. Inovio/ABC-3100 approval in progress by Dongfanglue Chinese affiliate. The FDA failure to enable 3100 approval is not delaying approval in China. A lifesaving treatment for many at risk women. Globally, **cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women, with around 660 000 new cases in 2022**. In the same year, about 94% of the **350 000** deaths (note: greater than 50%), caused by cervical cancer occurrs in low- and middle-income countries. The highest rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality are in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), Central America and South-East Asia. Regional differences in the cervical cancer burden are related to inequalities in access to vaccination, screening and treatment services, risk factors including HIV prevalence, and social and economic determinants such as sex, gender biases and poverty. Women living with HIV are 6 times more likely to develop cervical cancer compared to the general population, and an estimated 5% of all cervical cancer cases are attributable to HIV *(1)*. Cervical cancer disproportionately affects younger women, and as a result, **20% of children who lose their mother to cancer do so due to cervical cancer** ***(2)*****.**

  
ApolloBio (aka Dongfanglue of China) reports the Chinese infection rate of vaginal HPV is approximately 100 million women. (Inovio has a profit sharing agreement in the low teens %). Chinese approval is initial step to UK/EU and USA approval for HPV HSIL vaginal cancer. 

Another 3100 application for anal cancer is also in progress, which carries risk of cancer, for which the USA rate of infection is 110,000 new cases a year. The expected 2025 approval of 3107 will spark interest in Inovio, enabling funding studies necessary for approval of INOVIO 3100 (110,000 new cases a year) and 3112 (throat cancer- 20,000 new cases per year); and 5401, for brain cancer (GBM 15,000- 10,000 annual fatalities). Since these are lifesaving medical applications, the marketplace demand is secure and likely profitable.

Why hasn't the CDC recommended a second booster (4th shot) of mRNA vaccines for adults under 50? As some who is very eager to get another booster, it feels like things have stalled since the CDC authorized it for adults 50+. Is there a reason for this? My impression was that each shot remains effective for around 6 months. For myself and others I know under 50, we're well past that point.	1
"Potential help for long term survivors experience severe neck stiffening/fibrosis Just want to caveat all of this with I am not recommending anything I explain in this post. This was purely my experience and continues to be my experience. But..if you are as desperate as I was, you may take some inspiration from what helped me. About  a 5-10 minute read. Scroll down to the breakthrough if you don't want to read the history. 

**History**: Left tonsil blew up in January 2012. By ""blew up"" it swelled to about 3/4"" turned a very dark blue with some white spots. Didn't hurt. Had seen an ENT a year earlier about a lump in my upper left throat. ENT scoped me and showed me the door saying nothing wrong with me. A year later, he was my ENT on the team and was scared to do surgery as the tumor (the swollen area I was complaining about) was too big and he was worried, he  would cut some crucial nerves. I was given several choices and radiation/cisplatin seemed the best at the time. Cancer ended up being HPV related and had also spread to several lymph nodes in my neck. 3/4 of the treatment zapped the tumors via 10 different location. The last 1/4 then focused on the main tumor.

Took about a year, but I got maybe 70% of my saliva production back, 60% of my taste and I have very little smell. I explain it as tasting in Sepia tones. Since treatment, I have not been able to easily swallow solid foods and I'm hypersensitive to anything grainy down to even mashed potatoes. Most of the time, I do smoothies and will power through trying to eat in hopes of one day, it somehow gets easier. 

In 2019, I started noticing my neck getting stiff. I also noticed that going to the gym really aggravated my neck even though I wasn't lifting anything really heavy so I stopped going to the gym. My neck didn't get better.. It just got worse and worse to the point it was just about rock hard with increasingly bad nerve pain. Got to the point where I couldn't do anything without neck pain. So... I started cycling through all the options.

1. Physical therapy. Told my PT about my history and he had me doing all the usual things. Nothing helped..which makes sense now knowing what the problem was.

2. Chiropractic. It's soft tissue, not bone, so I had very little faith it would do anything and wasn't surprised when it didn't.

3. Massage. My wife would give me neck massages but it just wasn't doing anything. Given what happened later, lucky her massages didn't cause a stroke

I think around 2020, I got online and found a research paper from someone regarding post radiation fibrosis. I emailed the person and among the recommendations was percussion massage.

4. Persussion massage. I bought one of those handheld percussion massages. I used the ball and the pointy end and tried to beat the fibrosis into submission (which, you'll see in a bit was stupid). When I was feeling especially fired up, I'd really dig in with the pointy attachment. Pretty much did nothing over a few months other than make me really dizzy at times. 

I knew something was very wrong when I was hiking down a steep descent one day and had a very minor slip. The slope is important because slipping on to your rearend and arms isn't that big of a deal on steeper slope. Almost like just sitting down a little hard, but it caused me a couple weeks of pain and being unable to lift my arm. 

In early 2021, I went on a long plane flight to visit family for a week and the day before heading back, I went to get a neck massage just to try and loosen it up a bit. About 3/4 through, my neck was in sort of a prone position when I started feeling funny. Almost completely disconnected from my body. When I stood up, I couldn't speak clearly, and I perceived my right arm as a 6' long piece of spaghetti at which point I fell down with my right hand spasming. I managed to mumble ""call 911"".

More to it , but I ended up making it home, went to the emergency room and found out I had 2 strokes, one in the front and one in the left rear. 

5. Acupuncture. After a few months of rehab, I was trying to figure out what to do next. Looking online, I found a chiropractor that recommended some neck exercise to strengthen the neck (just in general...not anything cancer related). I also thought I'd try acupuncture since we'd be moving from the area soon and it was covered under the money I put into the prepaid medical. The acupuncturist was hesitant as she didn't think she could really help. As it turns out..she was mostly right. Helped very little after maybe 10 sessions, but it helped some..enough to tell me maybe there was some hope.

My neck exercises were slow going. First, my neck was super weak. These were just head weight exercises and I couldn't lift my head more than 6 times. Second, there was an immense amount of nerve pain, especially when I'd do head side lifts.

We ended up moving to another state and once we got settled, I started doing neck exercises every day and that's when I had a breakthrough.

**The breakthrough:**  

One day, after doing one of the neck exercises, I was laying on my side and decided to push into my neck with my thumb. It was a portion of my neck that literally felt like bone, but that didn't make sense as there was no bone in that area. I just kept pushing...harder..and increasingly harder..using what felt like most of my strength when..I got some movement. Not a lot, but definitely gave way. I tried a few other places and the same thing happened. Couldn't believe it!

So from then on, I'd do a particular exercise and rest, but during that rest period, I'd spend around 15 minutes digging in to spots all around the hard portions of my neck. On to the next set, then more digging, etc. So at least an hour every day. Left side was worse than the right side.

I did that for about 3 months and I finally was seeing a bit of relief and slight improvement in range of motion. I'd managed to loosen up a full layer of the fibrotic tissue all over my neck. 

The next 3 month were more difficult. That next layer got down into where nerves were either in the tissue, or right below but those areas on the extreme sides of the neck down to where the neck muscles connect in with the shoulders were VERY sensitive and painful. Slow going. Not only that, but there were nodules or swollen lymph nodes that were also very sensitive and painful. Just kept pushing. The strength in my neck was getting better as I could do 3 sets of 20 for each exercise giving me 60 reps. Exposing those sensitive nerve areas was causing me headaches and extended muscle spasms that I just accepted as part of the process and hoped it would get better. 

By the end of the next 3 months my ROM was probably 80% and most of my pain, headaches, and spasms had disappeared.

The next 3 months I got down into a another layer. Those swollen nodules or lymph nodes still required care, but most everything else was progressing as normal. By the end of those 3 months, I had probably 95% of my ROM back and pretty much pain free. I got up to 60 reps on my neck exercises.

**Maintenance:**

I sort of lost some motivation and went into maintenance mode and slowly slacked off more and more for the next 2 years to the point I wasn't doing any exercise or massage for weeks at a time. There were still hard areas and sensitive areas, but I was pain free and my ROM was good. 

**Current Situation:** 

Wife and I moved overseas and once we got settled, I recently started back in and was pretty shocked at how weak my neck had become. Also, the stiffness was getting slightly worse, which worried me. The last 3 weeks, I've been hitting it hard 5 days a week, doing pretty much what I did those first 3 months of the breakthrough. My left neck muscles are clearly weaker and it's been difficult to get the strength back up but it seems to be improving slightly. Right side is back up to strength. I've really been motivated to dig in to those hard areas and seem to be making some progress. Focusing on those nodule/lymph node areas as well and seem to be making good progress. On a scale of 1-100%, I'd say I've broken through 80% of the fibrotic areas. So a good 20% left to go. Kicking myself for backing off for a couple years. No excuse just tired. 

**Hope for future:** 

I don't know if it's possible, but I hope if I can break through 100% all of this fibrosis and keep the motivation to continue getting in there to dig and sort of re-orient the tissues that perhaps, I can get enough blood flowing through the entire area to stimulate some healthy muscle growth and maybe actually replace all the fibrosis area with healthy muscle. Probably a slim chance but the only way to know is to try. Best Worst case is it's a lifetime maintenance issue. Worst case is the left neck muscles continue to deteriorate regardless of what I do. 

**Technique:** 

The technique is pretty simple. I hold my hand up with your fingers together and my thumb extended. If I'm digging in to the left neck, I'll place the fingers on the back of the head with the thumb over the hard area. I'll kind of tilt the lower thumb up to orient the tip of my thumb where it can get in and point pressure on the hard area. I'll then push slowly and increase the pressure until I get some movement and then push slowly down the neck if the area has been broken up; otherwise I just move to individual areas to break them up. Eventually, I can sort of push down the neck and can feel a wave of material moving in front of my thumb.. Sometimes, the pressure is pretty close to as hard as I can push. Sensitive areas, I back off obviously, but still put constant pressure and eventually, I get some movement.  

**Risks:**

Well, personally, I had a stroke caused from a massage but at that time, my neck was in a strange position and the fibrosis was at full stiffness. It's possible that the percussion massage I had been doing loosened up a piece of scar or fibrotic tissue or perhaps, with my neck in a strange position, the massage put some unusual pressure on a fibrotic area around the main artery. No idea. Original MRI showed some kind of blockage but personally, I couldn't see anything other than taking the Neurologist word for it that what he was showing me was a bad blockage. Ultrasound on my neck and heart showed everything was clean and my blood pressure was very good. Follow on MRA and CTA showed everything clear and no blockages anywhere. Had a second neurologist look at all the scans and they confirmed that everything looked clean. It's in the back of my mind when I put a lot of pressure on the left side but it's a risk I decided to accept. I had to do something though. 

The follow-on radiation side effects that creep up over the years can be no joke. As mentioned by others, doctors typically don't talk to much about.. At least mine didn't. I suppose that's for many reasons. For those of you fighting fibrosis related neck stiffness, I wish you all the best with however you choose to address the issue. Hopefully, it's minor and you can get some relief with some of the more standard protocols."	0

There's very little info online, the only info I can find is some sites saying not to drink for 48 hours after the Japanese encephalitis vaccine but it doesn't specify why e.g. is this because of side effects or is this because it'll effect how the vaccine works? 

Also any info about how the vaccines actually work in the body would be helpful to know e.g. what happens after 48 hours of getting a vaccine? Has your body already made the necessary reaction it needs to do for the vaccine? Maybe this is why drinking 48 hours after is okay?"	0
"Cleared genital wart strain Hello all. Most of you will already know me as one of the mods here on r/HPV. I'm posting to let you all know that I have cleared HPV about one year after being diagnosed with genital warts. I had recurring warts pretty much nonstop for 8 or 9 months, but after a few months with no symptoms, I decided to take a test to see whether I still carried the virus. I took two tests which looked for low-risk, wart-causing strains. Both tests came back negative.

The only thing I really changed about my lifestyle to try and beat the virus was my diet. At the recommendation of my nurse, I tried to eat at least 5 different 'colours' of fruit and vegetables a day. I tried to limit takeaways and other unhealthy meals to once or twice a week. The healthy eating habits I formed will stay with me for a lifetime. I got plenty of sleep. I did only light exercise. I continued to drink alcohol little and often. I don't smoke. I did take some oral zinc, and a few weeks of AHCC, but very sporadically. I cannot say with certainty whether any of these things made a difference. I had HPV at university (a verruca) and that went away on its own and never came back - and I was drinking lots and eating terribly. But improving my diet certainly made me feel better.

I thought it was important to share this story. Genital warts are very common (indeed, out of the three people I told, two of them know someone who had them!) and most of the people who get them will clear them - and yet only a tiny fraction of these people will post their story on this sub. Hopefully, my story will give hope to other people who have also been diagnosed. 9 out of 10 people clear HPV within 2 years, and many will actually clear within the year. It was true for me. Trust the science.

I'm happy to answer any questions about my experience - but in accordance with our rules, please comment your questions here and do not message me privately.

Edit: I’ve had several people comment asking me which test I used. The test I used is the one from the post on my profile (genital wart test for UK women)."	0
"Dating a guy who accepts my HPV/HSV-1/LEEP Stuff Hi ya'll,

This post is for those scared of dating because of having HPV. I'm a Female in my younger 20's with HPV and HSV-1 genitally. I found out I had both last summer. I've had HSV-1 breakouts and had genital warts this year. Had the last lasered off in the summer. Anyways, I met this guy a couple months ago. I was scared to tell him I had HPV and HSV-1. When I told him he said ""it's just a skin condition"" and he didn't care since he has HSV-1 orally. We both got STD checked to make me feel more comfortable. He's my boyfriend now. Unfortanetly, I have to get the LEEP procedure done in a month but i'm glad he's supportive and will be there for me. Wish me luck and goodluck to you all!"	0
"The vaccine debate is drastically oversimplified by you vax folks. As Ben Goldacre says ""It's a bit more complicated than that"". I'd say that vaccines are one of the most complicated medical topics of discussion, and it's incredibly complex and sometimes requires a counter intuitive perspective, a big picture perspective, and a overall weighing of the benefits and cons. 

It's also a very important and serious debate.

It, depending on the criteria you apply, can be bewilderingly complex to analyse such questions.

I mean, take benefits to cons for example.

How do we create, a criterium of which people can agree on, to determine, for example, how bad autism is, compared to say measles induced deafness?

I say, 3 -> ?? points for autism, and 4 -> ?? point's for deafness. 

Ehh.. well.. I just pulled that from my ass.

On top of this, you have to consider the likeliness of these things, the vast levels of severity of these things, all in conjuncture with thousands of other variables, factors and philosophical questions.

Such as, at the extreme, the butterfly effect, I mean we can go that far..

Or the trivial, the long term to short term  factors. Such as, whether or not con A, is worth it, in the necessary attainment of benefit B in the future.

And when you start to consider all the variables, and chaos of determining and weighing things out, it really says that there is no easy answers.

Is 25,000 dying from vaccines, better than 45,000 dying from diseases?

Well, we can consider this:

What if dying from these diseases, provokes us to change the living conditions, dietal practices, hygienic practices, sanitative practices, social practices (sex), medical practices, educational practices, and many other things, that in turn, would save many more lives over the next 50-years, than would have been, had they been having vaccines instead.

And the same could be asked the other way round, and the same would work for every single thing that is considered..

As you can see, it's not as straight forward as one might think.

I think, the reason it is extended oversimplified, is based on the comfort that everyone has in eating mental chocolate over mental broccoli.

Never presume safety. Science works from a hypothesis, that is set out to be disproved.

Marketing works from a hypothesis, that is set out to be proved, and then put into business.

Vaccines are always presumed safe, and effective, but being reasonablu skeptical, and questionitive (my new word, no idea why it's not already) rarely ever contributes to a bad thing.

Unless of course, you have something to lose?

I wonder what that might be?

Maybe, just maybe, it's that it's a result of jumping to conclusions, that leave you thinking your on a boat above water, and this boat is keeping you from drowning. Don't jump to conclusions, unless you want to be wrong.

Instead, check to see if there's really any water, and if this boat is really the thing holding you up."	0
"I can not decide on getting the HPV vaccine or not getting it I am 32M. I am single and I had some partners in my life. I don't know when can I find the one whom I want to live with as a permanent partner. I am an immigrant from a poor situation and I live in italy. It takes time to stablize my life. So there maybe more sexual partners in the future of my life.

I have been doing research on the hpv vaccine, reading papers on NIH regarding the ingredients, effectiveness and safety of the hpv vaccine. I also read some interviews with one of the creators of the hpv vaccine, Dr Dian Harper. And I also have seen some cases in the news that have developed autoimmune deseases/paralysis after the hpv vaccine. The problem I have is that the reasons not to get the vaccine weigh equal to the reasons to get the vaccine in my eyes. What if it takes care of hpv for just 10 years. Then what? What if I get severe side effects after the shot? What if my body can take care of the virus and the shot is unnecessary? And many more what ifs.

I also have seen some research on curing the hpv infection using the AHCC extraction or other methods. I tell to myself worst case scenario, I would use these methods to cure my hpv instead of getting the 3 doses vaccine.

What should I do? I'm confused and lost."	0
"Controversial Opinion: I am as “antivaxx” as I can be and think this whole pandemic (aka bad flu season) was entirely made up (whether by careless incompetence or greed or both) - BUT this latest veritas video with Pfizer director looks super staged/fake Ok so - as title states, I am completely on the same page as everyone here regarding how deadly covid is (aka it isn’t) and how “safe and effective” these vaccines are (they’re not)  - but this video with the guy who is supposedly the Director of research at Pfizer, on a date with one of the secret journalist, just doesn’t look real at all. His initial reaction of “is this real life” and all of his acting that followed was so bad IMO. Like none of it seemed real.

"Why is this sub so small? I thought everybody in the world has HPV? Seeing as how there are no answers to most of the important questions (am I contagious? How long will I have it?), no clear set of behavior/disclosure  guidelines, and no cure, and a feeble vaccine that takes 6 months to complete, why aren’t there a lot more people on this sub?

Maybe everyone doesn’t have HPV afterall. Or maybe they do if you count the kind on their finger or one of the 100’s of kinds of genital HPV that don’t cause any disease at all but get lumped in with the kinds that cause warts. Why would they do that?

Edit: So the subtext of my post is that, ‘No, not everyone has HPV’, or at least they don’t have the kind with consequences (warts). The ‘everyone has HPV’ rap should be retired and the CDC etc should recommend disclosure behavior policy based off the fact that only a minority of the population has HPV infection with visible consequences."	0
"INOVIO News Inovio receives FDA feedback …
October 10th 2023

Previously planned Phase 3 trial no longer required to support Biological License Application (BLA) submission

If approved, INO-3107 could potentially revolutionize treatment options for patients with Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (RRP), a debilitating rare disease caused by human papillomavirus (HPV)

INO-3107 could be the first DNA medicine available in the United States and the first commercial product for INOVIO

PLYMOUTH MEETING, Pa., Oct. 10, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- INOVIO (NASDAQ:INO), a biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing DNA medicines to help treat and protect people from HPV-related diseases, cancer, and infectious diseases, today announced that it has received feedback from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that data from its completed Phase 1/2 trial of INO-3107 for the treatment of RRP could support INOVIO's submission of a BLA for review under the FDA's accelerated approval program. The FDA also advised that the company's previously planned Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trial would not be required to support this submission. INOVIO will be required to initiate a confirmatory trial prior to BLA submission for accelerated approval and satisfy all other FDA filing requirements. The design of the confirmatory trial has not yet been finalized. If approved, INO-3107 would be the first DNA medicine in the United States and the first INOVIO candidate to receive regulatory approval.

""Following the recent grant of Breakthrough Therapy Designation for INO-3107 for the treatment of RRP, we're grateful for the additional feedback from the FDA providing a potentially accelerated development pathway. We believe INO-3107 could become a game-changing treatment option for those suffering from RRP, a serious and often difficult-to-treat disease,"" said INOVIO's President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Jacqueline Shea. ""We're now focused on streamlining our development plan to support submission of a BLA for accelerated approval. We would like to thank the patients and investigators who have participated in our trials to date.""

""I commend the FDA for recognizing the immense burden RRP puts on patients and the critical need for a better standard of care,"" said the President of the Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis Foundation, Kim McClellan. ""I'm thrilled by the progress being made for RRP patients who are desperate for an alternative to surgery.""

INOVIO's completed Phase 1/2 open-label, multicenter trial assessed INO-3107's safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and efficacy in patients with HPV-6 and/or HPV-11-related RRP (NCT:04398433). The trial evaluated the reduction in the number of surgical interventions in the year following initial administration of INO-3107 compared to the year prior to treatment. Patients received four doses of INO-3107 on Day 0, and Weeks 3, 6, and 9. Overall, 81.3% (26/32) of patients in the trial had a decrease in surgical interventions in the year after INO-3107 administration compared to the prior year, including 28.1% (9/32) that required no surgical intervention during or after the dosing window. Patients in the trial had a median range of 4 surgeries (2-8) in the year prior to dosing. After dosing, there was a median decrease of 3 surgical interventions (95% confidence interval -3, -2). At the outset of the study (Day 0), patients could have RRP tissue surgically removed, but any surgery performed after Day 0 during the dosing window was counted against the efficacy endpoint. Treatment with INO-3107 generated a strong immune response in the trial, inducing activated CD4 T cells and activated CD8 T cells with lytic potential. T-cell responses were also observed at Week 52, indicating a persistent cellular memory response. INO-3107 was well tolerated by participants in the trial, resulting in mostly low-grade (Grade 1) treatment-emergent adverse effects such as injection site pain and fatigue.

Data from this Phase 1/2 trial were presented earlier this year at scientific and medical conferences, including the 2023 Annual Meeting of the American Broncho-Esophageal Association (ABEA) in May and at the European Laryngological Association's Annual Meeting in June. Data from the trial was also published in May in the peer-reviewed journal, The Laryngoscope, under the title ""Interim Results of a Phase 1/2 Open-Label Study of INO-3107 for HPV-6 and/or HPV-11–Associated RRP."" The Laryngoscope is the official journal of the Triological Society (TRIO), the American Laryngological Association (ALA), and the ABEA.

INO-3107 is INOVIO's lead candidate and one of three clinical-stage DNA medicine candidates targeting HPV-related disease. INOVIO's DNA technology has been studied in twelve HPV-related trials, ranging from Phase 1 to Phase 3, involving more than 900 patients in 20 countries with a variety of HPV-related diseases, including RRP, HSIL (cervical, anal and vulvar) and head and neck cancers. Shared observations in these trials include the ability of DNA medicines to generate HPV antigen specific T cells and a persistent cellular memory response, viral clearance and lesion regression, and no anti-vector immune responses. All three HPV-related product candidates (INO-3107, INO-3112 and VGX-3100) have been well tolerated in these trials."	0
"What if I just want safer, more effective vaccines? What if I feel that they're not as safe as they should be, and want to find out how unsafe they are.. or that some are not necessary and only make things worse?

What if I just think that the vaccine schedules aren't as good or as safe as they should be?

What if I think we aren't doing our best? 

What if I think we aren't be skeptical enough?

Moderna mRNA vaccine, does it change your genome? I know that mRNA goes to the ribosome to create proteins and this mRNA has been designed to produce spike proteins so your immune system can make antibodies. But I’ve heard online that the mRNA could actually end up changing your genome, like how a herpes virus can infect a hosts genome and remain dormant in the hosts cell for a long time. Do you think there is reason to worry about this? I’m asking because my mom is a teacher and I’m worried that the vaccine hasn’t been tested enough and she’s going to be a human guinea pig.	-1

"[27m] 8 month journey over. Am free! *""If you have genital warts, you're about to not have genital warts.""*

For the large majority of us, warts are temporary and transient. 
See my previous post, but I went through the ringer including surgery for my warts. 

**My journey**

I thought I'd post an update for anyone who was interested. I'm male, 27yo, had 4 large warts in the sensitive area underneath my foreskin, tried aldara, cryo, surgery and finally podophyllotoxin along with Zinc + immune supplements. This ruined me temporary - I'm a young professional who was really ready to start dating finally. It felt isolating, and I felt dirty. To combat this, I told 2 of my closest friends about my situation who supported me, and did my best to keep a good mindstate. I ran, I ate healthy, I cut back on smoking. 

**The recovery**

Amazingly, a month after applying podophyllotoxin my visible warts just melted away, and I've had nil recurrence since (almost 5 months now). Podophyllotoxin all the way! (warning: do not confuse with *podophyllin*) 

Unfortunately the healing time was not without complication, as I would soon be diagnosed with balanitis afterwards (penis inflammation). This cleared up however with a combination of steroids and fungal cream (all bought over the counter at the chemist). Currently however, my bits and pieces are back to normal!! 

For the guys, suck it up and go to the Doctor if you can. It's really not that bad. If cryo didn't work for you the first time around, I recommend Podophyllotoxin over Aldara. It's a little solution you apply with a cottonbud twice a day for 3 days. And yup - it melts the warts away.

**The lessons**

Here is what I learnt through my trip - mental health is important. You are not dirty, most people have it, they just don't know. It isn't your fault either. You didn't *choose* to have HPV, nobody does, so stop beating yourself up for it. Also remind yourself that this subreddit attracts the crazier cases that aren't sorted, and is probably not representative of most the population who will recover fully. Reading too many horror cases can be pretty anxiety inducing, so a grain of salt goes a long way. 

The moderator of this subreddit, u/xdhpv, once private messaged me and said the biggest indicator that HPV is temporary is the fact that so many accounts on this subreddit become active and then inactive after a few months. Most people who recover, won't post that they've recovered. Stay strong everyone, keep in mind that sadness comes in waves, so feel free to re-visit this post and remind yourself that you'll be fine.

With all this said - thanks for reading. It's finally my turn to become inactive here, and trust me, eventually it will be *yours*."	-1
"Are lipid nanoparticles something to worry about? Hi, I (29M) have just found this subreddit. I live in the UK and am triple vaxxed for Covid (2x Astra Zeneca in and 1x Moderna booster, all in 2021).  

I suffer from health anxiety and have some antivax friends who constantly send me information about the rise in cancers in young people and heart attacks etc. I was hesitant about the mRNA technology at the time, so was glad to get the AZ vaccine but they had withdrawn it by the time I was eligible for the booster. I decided to get it anyway because I trusted the scientists. 

To this day I feel worried that I made the wrong decision. I came across an antivaxxer on Twitter who said the lipid nanoparticles are the issue and that they accumulate in the body. I’m just wondering if anyone could shed some light on this please?

"Proof that Vaccines cause Autusm by publichealth.org The widespread fear that vaccines increase risk of autism originated with a 1997 study published by Andrew Wakefield, a British surgeon. The article was published in The Lancet, a prestigious medical journal, suggesting that the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine was increasing autism in British children.

The paper has since been completely discredited due to serious procedural errors, undisclosed financial conflicts of interest, and ethical violations. Andrew Wakefield lost his medical license and the paper was retracted from The Lancet.

Nonetheless, the hypothesis was taken seriously, and several other major studies were conducted. None of them found a link between any vaccine and the likelihood of developing autism.

2. She claims that the hospital does not allow them to enter vaccine related injuries or health issues on the OSHA forms as part of regulation, and that this is akin to a coverup as ""she sees the logs every day, and there are HUNDREDS of people with issues.""

"6 month follow up pap from CKC?? had my 6 month follow up pap on 05/21/24. Had my CKC July 2023 and my pap in November came back negative as well.

"I was replying to someone, and I thought I made some useful pointd so I'll post my response here. >yet if you wanted you could actually do research into biology, and disprove all of the vaccine ""propaganda"" yourself with factual, observable evidence.

Unfortunately I'm not going to pursue a career I don't want to pursue, in order to make a change that I could almost make without pursuing it.

The thing is, if I go any work as a biologist, they won't listen to me anyway, we see this with experts like Christopher Exely, Christopher Shaw, James Lyons Wylier, Andrew Zimmerman, Theresa Deisher, jack wolfson, Zhibin Yao, Peter gotzche, Peter Aaby, Lluis Lujan, suzanne humphries, bob sears, andrew wakefield, john walker smith, romain k gherdardi, richard kelly, simon murch, etc.. They all are censored, ignored, vilified, scapegoated, projected, filtered out from mainstream, and slandered. 98% of the time with NO justification whatsoever.

Here's a thought, I considered going to university and college to get a degree in a biology field, so I could enter a pharmaceutical company or government company (CDC, FDA) and then I realized, well, would I get in, even with qualifications? Well, no fucking way. They'd interview me, and if they thought I posed a scientific threat to their company's reputation (say they figured I wasn't going to be easily manipulated, and I was too questioning and critical for their liking) they'd just deny me a job there. Anyone that is critical of big pharma, won't be allowed into big pharma, hence why big pharma is full of people who agree with big pharmas science, because the people who disagreed, weren't allowed in. Filtering is a massive astroturfing technique, it allows big pharma, CDC, FDA, to say ''look all the mainstream scientists say vaccines are good and effective'' when in reality, they ohly allow scientists that would benefit this view, into mainstream science institutes and companies. The critical, free thinking, knowledgeable scientists, are basically forced into a low ranking job, away from power. Isn't that convenient!

>Yet you dont, and there are only two reasons for this that I can think of, you either dont want to do research for fear that you will be proven wrong

I've researched at the highest level I can, with the resources I have available. I don't need a laboratory and an extensive knowledge in pathology to understand basic statistics, history, philosophy, and politics. 

Also, I'd like to stress, that there is absolutely no reason whatsoever that I would like to believe that concurrent and historical vaccine usage is a net negative to the health of the world. I would love to believe anything but this! I'm absolutely horrified by what I find about vaccines. The exact reason I am against vaccines, is because I believe they are KILLING people. I definitely do not want to this to be the case, also because I have literally developed anxiety, panic attacks, heart issues, breathing problems, depression and all kinds of other things, purely due to the sheer stress that this whole vaccine situation has caused me. I absolutely fucking HATE it. I would instantaneously discard my views of vaccines with any good reason to do so. I have yet to find any. 

Why on earth would I want to believe that (I'm not a mother, but say I was) my ACTIONS, had resulted in my child being, KILLED, injured, autistic, or underdeveloped, for very little benefit or none at all?

Why would I WANT TO BELIEVE THAT? Am I going insane? Or am I demonstrably right? 

>and you say that all the research done by credible universities cant ve trusted because ""big pharma"" wont let the truth be let out

I'd say that a large amount of the research is poorly carried out and presented. It's manipulated, selectively carried out, hidden, distorted, magnified, overstated, financially driven, bias driven, understated, cherry picked, and culturally driven. 

I also have no care for appeals to authority or credibility. If they're wrong, they're wrong. I don't care if it's a ''credible university'' or ''top scientists'' I care if it's true or not. 

Here's an example: In denmark, a study was carried out to try and prove mmr vaccines have no autism link. You probably would say this is credible and reasonable, however, it doesn't take an Einstein to figure out that comparing ALL VACCINES with ALL VACCINES - MMR, is not a fair way to determine whether or not MMR causes autism. It's predicated on the mathematical notion that says biology works like a maths equation. When this is false. Biology is not mathematical. You can't compare a body hit by 7 bullets and a body hit by 6 bullets and say that because the amount of blood is the same or almost the same, that there is no significant link between an individual 7th bullet and blood loss, mostly because the body is extremely complicated, and it's not like your body is equally distributed with blood, and it's not like your body reacts to things individually the same as it reacts to things commutativity. They, still haven't, although they have tried to claim they have, done any real comparison of MMR vaccinated, against non vaccinated, with relation to autism. Why? Because they know what they will find if they do a proper study. 

>or you are too lazy to do actual research and only rely information found on social media

I use all kinds of available resources, whether that is google, books, lectures online, documents, talks, documentaries, interviews, testimonies, statistics, doctors, experts ect..

Social media is not a source. Social media is a platform. That is it. 

Calling social media some kind of unreliable source, is like calling paper, unreliable as a source for information. It's the books that I'm looking at, not the paper.

>wich is obviously biased and slanted toward similar opinions and ideologies to yours. So wich is it.

No buddy, you're far far off the reality. Social media is 99% consumed with pro vaccine content, and 1% anti vaccine content. And it's worse than THAT!

Most anti vaccine content is censored, removed and filtered by google and big tech. Don't believe me? There's quite literally campaigns that set out by big media, big tech, and big pharma, to prevent any unfavourable information about vaccines, from being platformed. 

Why do they need to censor us? If the truth is on their side? Why do they need to censor us, if they're not worried about a revolution? 

Why did they wait till 2017-2018 to start censoring us properly? Because the internet has allowed a huge spread of information across the globe, and a mass sharing of stories and studies that wouldn't normally be present together, that has allowed us to see through the dilution of information. 

Maybe you should drop all your preconceived notions, cultural norms, and hopes, and look at the situation critically, and freshly, through a lens of gaining truth, and not through a lens of agreeing with whatever dur scientist man said on corrupt foundations. 

Because I think the only position that can be reached, after an honest and critical examination of vaccinations, is that at the very least, it's a whole lot less pretty and good as it is made out to be by corrupt vaccine makers."	-1
"Help! My girlfriend has HPV So your girlfriend went for a routine doctor's appointment and then you found out it was something called a smear test and they tested for HPV. Wtf - your girlfriend has an STD?!!!

You should read the sticky post here to educate yourself fully, but to present a more concise primer, here are a few things in particular that you should know:

(NB: for ease, have written men and women but please assume people with penises and people with cervixes if you are trans, nb or other. I've also based this mainly on positive smear results rather than warts, because this is a more common incident that we see on this board) .

**Having HPV is extremely normal:**

\- 80% of people will get genital HPV by the age of 45, and after a few sexual partners, your chance is close to 100%. 

\- Most infections happen within the first few years of sex life, so prevalence in late teens to early 20s is very high - almost half of women of this age will have an active high risk infection right now. For all types of HPV it may be as high as 70% for college-aged women. Note that the figures are probably similar for men.

**Most people don't know they have it:**

\- Most HPV infections are symptomless,

\- In most places, cervical smears are only done after a certain age and may only be tested for HPV after a certain age, too (e.g. 25+). This is because it's simply assumed that younger people will have HPV and it will probably go away with no problems. Cervical smears with HPV tests are designed to find those persistent cases that don't clear up, and can therefore pose a potential danger. 

**HPV can hang around for a while and recur later in life:**

**-** Most infections clear up within a couple of years, but some last longer. 

\- A small % can come back even after immune suppression

\- Therefore, even if you've been in a monogamous relationship for some time, it's still not weird for HPV to come up

**Do I have HPV too?**

If you've been having regular sex (genital or oral contact), even with condoms (which only mitigate but don't prevent HPV transmission), there's a good chance you share the infection. Maybe it came from her, maybe it came from you. **Where it came from is both impossible to know and not very important**. 

(I've not seen data on dental dams but we know that female/female couples often share infections, too).

You should probably assume that you either have her strain now, or may have already immune suppressed it.

**How can I have an STD? I've never had one before**

STD panels only test for a small number of possible infections, and even if you have been practising 'safe' sex, it's still very possible and indeed probable to have something (look up the prevalence of HSV, for example). With HPV in the mix, there is a very high chance that you have had, have or will have 'an STD' in future. 

In the modern world, because of the aftermath of the AIDs crisis, and our increased scientific knowledge, mixed with toxic purity culture, there is so much stigma around STDs. But HPV is something that's pretty much impossible to avoid - even virgins have a small chance of getting it, and with one lifetime partner the chance is somewhere between 20 and 70%. 

**If you are stigmatising your gf and/or yourself, just stop**. HPV is not something you can ever fully prevent, unless you were to live life in a polythene bubble. No sex is truly safe, but we take the risk because, when consensual, it's a good, fun, natural part of a healthy adult life.

P.S. don't use the word 'clean' - nobody is 'dirty' for living their life, and that includes you!

**Should I get tested?**

If you have a cervix, you don't need to rush to get a test outside of your regular smear schedule. In fact, they may not allow you to do this. This is because smear tests are a cancer-screening tool, not an STD test. As there's nothing one can do about an HPV infection and most just go away, it's not considered clinically relevant to constantly test for it. Cervical smears are done on a schedule because they want to find those infections that stick around, so the person can be monitored and potentially treated if it becomes necessary.

If you have a penis, in most places, testing is not commonly done. This is because it's both unreliable in commonly used methods, and clinically not very useful. 

**Will I get warts?**

If your girlfriend has been tested via a smear, it's likely that her infection is high risk. This is because most smear tests don't bother looking for the non-oncogenic strains. If you're not sure, she should clarify with her doctor. Most warts are caused by low-risk strains. While high-risk strains *can* cause warts, this is not hugely common so you should not expect to develop them (although it's perfectly possible to have more than one kind at a time, and in different parts of the genitals). 

**Can we still have sex?**

Yes, regular partners can keep having sex, because you will share the infection already. You may wish to use condoms, which are shown to lower the viral load shared between you and therefore make it easier for the body to deal with the infection. 

**Can we still have oral sex?**

If you're both unvaccinated, there is a risk that you share HPV16. This is the riskiest strain for oral cancer, so you might want to use protection or abstain from oral in that instance to lower the viral load in the mouth. However, if you weigh up the risk and feel that it is low enough to feel comfortable proceeding (e.g. she is vaccinated, or you know she has a strain other than 16) then sure, go ahead. 

**Should I get vaccinated?**

Imo, yes. Gardasil 9 protects you against 9 of the most prevalent and riskiest strains, including 7 cancer-causing types and the 2 that cause 90% of genital warts. Although it's not proven to help a current infection, there's some limited evidence to suggest it \*may\* help regress more advanced abnormalities and support male bodies to produce antibodies against the included strains. Additionally, it gives you future protection against the included types (and you're unlikely to have had all 9).

Men can get vaccinated, too, and it's licensed up to age 45. You should search for ways to get it in your location - it may be free in some cases (e.g. in the UK, if you have sex with men, or in countries with health insurance if covered by your provider), or you may need to pay.

**Am I going to get cancer?**

Although high risk strains of HPV *can* cause cancer, that doesn't mean they will. Relative to the numbers of cases, cancer is not a likely outcome. 

Cervical cancer remains the greatest risk of persistent HPV (those infections that hang around for a long time) but keeping up with screening means that anything dangerous is likely to be caught in time and can be treated. 

Oral cancer rates are rising and it's the greatest risk for men. That said, only 1% of oral HPV infections become cancerous. At the moment, there's no screening programme, because it's not a useful way to identify those infections that could persist and become dangerous. 

The best thing to do at the moment is to go to the dentist regularly and ask them to check you out. 

Penile, anal, vulval and vaginal cancers are not very common. You may be able to get an anal smear test, but it's not available everywhere. Otherwise, you should try not to obsessively think about this - many, many things in life give us a risk of cancer and we tend not to worry about them. Just keep a gentle eye on your health and do all the things you already know you should be doing to live a happy and healthy life.

**Do I need to go on a crazy health programme?**

No. There is some evidence that stopping smoking can help prevent HPV cancers, but you already know that smoking kills so why are you still doing it?! There's currently no data out there on weed or vaping, so you can make your own call on those ones. 

Exercise, sleep, eating vegetables - all good things for your health and life. But most people's bodies just deal with HPV naturally anyway, and there's no proven routine or single thing you can do to absolutely guarantee anything.

If it makes you feel better to do something, and you feel like making a change in your life, however, maybe this is your wakeup call.

**What about my future in dating?**

As above: most HPV infections go within a few months to a couple of years, and almost everyone will have a past or current infection. If you are seeking new partners imminently (i.e. in the next few months), you may want to discuss it with them (e.g. check if they're vaccinated), but beyond this, unless you have a cervix and get a positive test result at your next smear, there's no obligation - it's really up to you (there is a lot of nuance here and different people will have different strong feelings on the matter).

**What can I do to support my girlfriend?**

Thanks for asking **the most important question**. 

Your girlfriend might be worried, confused or upset. Many doctors are pretty rubbish at dealing with HPV-related stuff. Share any information you learn and make sure you approach HPV together in a non-judgemental way.

Ask if she wants you to accompany her to appointments, and afterwards, make her a nice hot drink, get her a blanket, bring her cookies, kiss the top of her head, you know - all the lovely partner things you can do to make her feel safe and loved. 

Some people might feel weird about sex after diagnosis so please be understanding and keep communicating how you both feel. Acting entitled and pissy because someone won't do xyz thing with you is jerk behaviour and if that's your attitude, fuck right off. 

Sex is not the only part of a relationship and if you need to pause on some things for a short while, nobody is going to die. Sex toys and masturbation are absolutely a thing. 

**If you are privileged enough to have a partner and a healthy, happy relationship, that is more important than an infection that almost everyone will get in their lifetime**. Lots of us with HPV don't have this luxury, so don't be a fool about this - thanks."	0
"Post your repeated anti-covidvax comments Its like a multi-level-marketing scheme, its like they're given a script to read out. When you argue with these people it's constantly the same replies.

Like this:

'Ivermectin is ignored and all these brave docs with everything to lose are doing better care for their patients than any of their hospital'

'Big Pharma doesn't want people to have Ivermectin'

'Jesus is my vaccine and the great physician'

"Are anti vaxxers brainwashed? Or are pro vaxxers brainwashed?

Who, out of these two subjects, looks more like a brainwashing victim?

The one who's been told by every teacher, every news story, every poster, advertisement, Google result, every doctor, every science book, and every film that vaccines are great and harmless.

Or the one guy who's been told by his Facebook friend about vaccine inserts and subsequently became against vaccination. 

Who sounds like they've had there brain abused into a position by authority, force, indoctrination, appeals to emotion, bigotry, censorship, guilt and slander? 

And who sounds like they've had a clean disabused brain inserted with a igniting thought that lead to a viewpoint?

Essentially who sounds like they achieved their opinion by self originating thought, and who sounds like they were brainwashed?"	0
"I (F21) found out I had intercourse with someone who just was told they probably have HPV We had intercourse about 3 weeks ago and today he went it and they said it’s likely HPV. I just scheduled to get my HPV vaccine (I know it doesn’t cure it, but just want to be safe) and ordered some AHCC. I haven’t had any symptoms (which I know may not show). I guess I just have a few questions 

1. Besides getting a pap and getting tested for it, is there anything else I can do?
2. Does ACHH actually work?
3. This one might be dumb, but since it’s skin contagious and I showered right after, could that have helped reduce my risk?
4. Any other things I might need to know?"	0

Feeling deflated, delaying Rad for the week Just feeling a little bit down and deflated for these last 9 treatments. Was hoping to be done by turkey day, but alas there were bigger plans than mine.   Radiation oncologist wants to delay treatment the rest of this week for my burns to heal and recover a little bit.  The burns are more severe and intense than what they should be at 26 weeks in, and he wants my skin, tissue, and other things to have a little bit of recover time before these last 9 treatments do their work.   Being my stubborn self, prolly would have toughed it out, but the Dr convinced me otherwise.   Am I delusional for wanting to push thru, or is that the radiation pain making me just want to be done and over with it all? The tumor has responded great to the treatments and has shrunken and is dying off faster then they anticipated so that’s at least a plus I guess.   48m/SCC HPV+/right tonsil and 2 lymph nodes.  	0

Anti vaccine family members Like the title says I have some anti vaccine family members, or as they put it “only the essential ones”my 1st thought was bitch you mean all of them. To be specific it’s my sister and mom. Apparently she didn’t get any vaccinations til she was a few months old. And my mom basically works in the medical field for about 9 years or so. And my sister had her kid about 3 1/2 years ago and she enrolled into college this year to go into the medical field. How are they both so stupid. I discovered this because my sister isn’t the brightest(obviously) and she told me this. How do I tell her she’s wrong? And since my mother believes the same thing bye cruel world been a fun 15 years.	1
"Vaxxers, you played yourself, again. ""All you have is dumb, made up reports from vaers saying vaccines injured a child, no actual evidence!""

So you admit that I'm right? That we have absolutely no way to know the extent of vaccine injury? 

That's why I'm vaccine critical! Because there's no safety STUDIES! No placebo double blind long term tests! No unvaxxed Vs vaxxed studies!

The poor evidence that you think makes me an idiot for relying on, is something I'm not relying on at all, I'm saying, why is the evidence soo poor? Why is this all we have got to go by?

So, next time a vaxxer says, ""you only have a few stupid reports to go on"".

Say to them, ""and so do you, that's why I'm cynical here, because we shouldn't have to rely on unconfirmed reports!"""	-1
"How likely is anal hpv to cause cancer ? For the moment, I have warts and hpv in my penis after vaginal sex with a lady. However, I am afraid to have hpv spread in my anal zone from fingering / toileting. 

Is hpv in the anus dangerous for men?  
How likely can it lead to cancer in the long run, if

1 scenario/ I do not have warts

2/ I do have warts but I do not remove them

3/ I do have warts and I remove them.  
i am a 25 years old, healthy and sporty non smoker man.

Last but not least, can hpv in my anus disappear completely within 2 years? (I read that for penis hpv in some website).

Edit: I have my penis warts removed by the doctor, but he want to see me again to check if warts develop again in the future."	0
"I cleared HPV 16/18. There is hope. On August 1st, I received the results back for my pap and was told they found abnormal cell changes showing CIN 3. I also showed positive for HPV 16/18/45. It was during that phone call when the earth dropped beneath my feet. I asked the NP if this meant I had cervical cancer and she said ""I just can't tell you that at this time. We need to do a biopsy."". When she heard the terror in my voice she said ""I'm so sorry"". Of course, this only made me feel even more afraid thinking she was expecting the worst. No one ever wants to hear their medical provider say ""I'm so sorry"".

I had an ultrasound and a colposcopy a few days later. I lived in HELL for the week that followed as I waited for my results. FINALLY, both confirmed the results of the pap- no cancer but I did have pre-cancerous CIN 3 that needed to be removed.

I had my coning procedure in September. It was my first time being put under and I was shaking like a leaf before surgery. I started crying uncontrollably when I had to say bye to my partner. I'm sure I looked like a crazy person being wheeled away in the bed towards the surgery room. Despite my fears, the coning procedure went much easier than I expected and I was back to normal within a few a few days.

Flash forward to today, December 17th. I went in for a 3 month post surgery pap last week to see how I was progressing and if there were any abnormal cell regrowth. I received my results back today that not only is there no cellular changes but I have no detectable HPV and I've cleared it within 3 months of the procedure. You always hear people say how scary something like this is but you don't full understand it until you've experienced it. Today is the first day that I've felt like I can breathe a full breath since I found out I had high risk HPV and had precancerous cells on my cervix. I was as worried as anyone that I was never going to kick it because everything on the internet tells you how hard it is to clear HPV 16 specifically. 

I'll tell you guys that I did make a lot of lifestyle changes. I stopped drinking alcohol- this was big considering I've been a classic binge drinker for 10 years. Drinking over 4+ drinks in a sitting a few times a month. I'm also known to smoke a few cigarettes when I'm drinking. Neither of which were doing any favors for my health. Since the first call in August, I've only ate whole foods and meals (nothing processed) and I've been hyper aware about eating nutrient dense foods every day to build my immune system. I didn't do supplements or anything like that. I figured I'd focus on getting my nutrients in my food.

Sorry for the length here but for the last few months I have been obsessed with just about every HPV related thread on Reddit. Some fueled my fear and left me spiraling at night while others gave me a lot of comfort. For everything that I gained through others sharing their stories on Reddit since this all began, I figured I had to share my story as well. 

If you have HPV and are scared- know that there is so much hope. Know that you are not alone and that you have a community of people who are experiencing exactly what you are right now. For som of you, I know that it's still a dark time but for many, we've made it through. And I hope that this post will be a small light to you as you find your way through what I know is a dark time. The light is coming.

Sending so much love to each of you.

"I am finally HPV 16 & CIN3 FREE!!! Glory be to the Most High GOD for divine healing.???? In September 2021, when I was 2 months pregnant, my OBGYN performed my first ever Pap test and the results came back NEGATIVE - for HPV & and abnormal cells.

Fast fowards to January 2023, 8 months after my son was born, I did my annual Pap test and the results came back POSITIVE with HPV 16 and abnormal cells in my cervix. My doctor followed up with a colposcopy and the biopsy came back with CIN3. How was that even possible to go from negative to positive to CIN3 that fast in just 15 months? 

My OBGYN quickly referred me to an Oncologist Gynecologist who scheduled me for a LEEP the following month, March 2023. All abnormal cells were removed successfully and further tested for cancerous cells, the results of the biopsy came back with a clear margin (No cancerous cells). Thank you LORD!!! ????

My OBGYN recommended that I come back after 6 months for another colposcopy to keep an eye on things. I did my research and found out that I could take some supplements to boost my immune system which will help fight HPV & also prevent CIN3, other grades of dysplasia (CIN1, CIN2) and cervical cancer.

I started taking a 1,000mg of Graviola (Soursop) pills, Indole 3 Cardinol 400mg, DIM 200mg, Immune System booster that contains (Zinc, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Tumeric, Ginger blend and Elderberry) Methyl Folate 400mcg, Methyl B-12 1,000mcg, Vitamin C 1,000mg, Glutathione 1,000mg and Hawaiian Astaxanthin 12mg. 

You don’t have to take every supplement I listed above, about 4-5 of them will clear the HPV & lesions right up and they can all be found on Amazon. My TOP 5 recommendations are Graviola, Methyl Folate, Vitamin C, Methyl B-12 and DIM (or Indole 3 Cardinol).

I took all of the supplements once a day, consistenly (I alternated) till my 6 months follow up appointment which was last week, August 7th. I went in for the colposcopy/biopsy and had to wait 7days for my results to come back. Today, August 15th, my doctor called me with the good news that my biopsy results came back and I’m all CLEARED. HPV 16 and CIN3 were both NEGATIVE (no sign of abnormal cells in my cervix. 

I have been screaming and over the moon about this good news because at my 6 months follow up appointment, my OBGYN had mentioned that she was going to refer me back to the Oncologist for a second procedure if the results comes back POSITIVE. And this time, it was going to be a Cold Knife Conization which is more invasive than LEEP. 

So for my results to come back all negative for HPV 16 & CIN3, I am so grateful to GOD for a clean bill of health. I believe our immune system becomes weak during pregnancy and after childbirth because my first Pap test was negative in 2021 so how I ended up going from negative pap to CIN3 just 8 months after childbirth is a mystery to me. Glory be to GOD!!! ????

I wanted to share my journey and testimony with those who are going through the same situation and are recommended to have a LEEP, Cold Knife Conization or hysterectomy. If I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't have gone through with the LEEP but I was so scared of the CIN3 progressing to cancer that I didn't think things through but I know BETTER now. 

If you want to have children in the future, I recommend to take supplements (do your research) and take the homeopathic route. Getting a LEEP or any other procedure only temporarily takes care of the dysplasia/lesions, if you still have HPV, the dysplasia/ lesions will come back and you would be recommended to have another LEEP, CKC or possibly a hysterectomy.

The goal is to clear the HPV entirely then you won't need to worry about cervical dysplasia or possible cervical cancer or throat cancer from oral sex."	1
"Should un-vaccinated folks deny health care for severe COVID cases? Data very clearly shows that severe cases of COVID (requiring hospitalization) caused by the virus and its variations are minimal for vaccinated individuals. But, let's say for arguments sake that I support everyone's decision to make their own judgment regarding the vaccine. Upon making a choice to not protect yourself, shouldn't those individuals be denied access to ICUs and hospitals should bad COVID symptoms arise? Similarly - I can choose not to wear a seatbelt but if I get into a car crash I'll fly through the window. I don't get why my tax money and health insurance money should be wasted supporting people who aren't taking very easy and obvious precautions. 

&#x200B;

Disclaimer: personally, I am clearly pro vaccine. The vast majority of people educated in medicine, virology, immunology, biology, and life sciences are similarly pro vaccine, and the educated folks who are anti vaccine are almost all studying fields outside of life science. Following the advice of an extremely intelligent software engineer who is anti-vax is the same as trusting a ""dentist"" who only has a PhD in theology. 

&#x200B;

So, you've declined the vaccine, fine! Will you also decline hospital care if you get sick? Or, are you not willing to put your money (health) where your mouth is?"	1
"Antivaxxer aunt's fearmongering This happened in the middle of the year 2020 but it still bothers me, to this day. 

So I have this ‘aunt’, not blood related, she’s an ex of one of my grandparents. They broke up 20 years ago. She still thinks she can assert some authority over all the grandchildren. She inserts unsolicited opinions about lives and choices and nitpicks everything. My sister and her boyfriend hadn’t really made their mind up about the vaccine, except for: “hey, if it works we can go party again safely!” That is until our ‘lovely aunt’ imposed some *priceless advice* about the vaccine.

My sister and her boyfriend, my girlfriend and I, met up in early 2020, to exchange some late Christmas gifts. Of course outside, wearing masks and keeping a safe distance. All is well until the vaccine gets brought up, my girlfriend has been very excited about it, she couldn’t wait until the world returned to normal.

My sister starts anxiously telling us that we should not get the vaccine because she heard some terrible things about it. Curious, we want to know the details. She starts telling us how in the 60’s there was this injection that doctors gave to pregnant women to alleviate morning sickness. Their babies were born with no arms and no legs! She tells us our aunt has told her and her boyfriend all of this. Aunt convinced them not to take the vaccine. Because who knows, maybe this vaccine can also cause the same side effects! There is not a chance in hell her boyfriend and her are taking this vaccine. Not only that but now they want to convince *us* not to take the vaccine either.

My girlfriend recognises this story. She tells them this doesn’t make any sense because thalidomide, that’s the injection they are talking about, was not a vaccine but a medicine. They sold this medicine in the 50’s and it was removed from the market in 1960 or something. She assures them that no vaccines have ever had such extreme side effects and that medicine development and production is quite different now in 2020 than it was in the 50’s. My sister and boyfriend are not reassured and now, they completely refuse to get vaccinated. They would like to start a family and are horrified one of their children could be born like that.

It took me a lot of convincing for my sister to still get the vaccine, her boyfriend was harder to convince and I to this day don’t know if they had had their repeat shots.

So my girlfriend and I got the vaccine in early June of 2020. I sent my aunt a message saying I got the astrazeneca vaccine because I was very happy with it. She sent me a message back that she had also had the same vaccine 2 months ago. What. I showed the message to my girlfriend. She blocked aunt on her phone immediately. She was waiting for the last drop with this aunt and this was it. I went no contact too some time later.

For her 5 seconds of enjoying asserting authority over people and commanding them what to do, she could have endangered my sister’s and her boyfriend's lives. Or caused at least some serious damage to their health.

Spicy details: aunt has a degree in sports science, she graduated in the 80’s. She often flaunts this degree, a lot of my family members didn’t even finish high school so this was impressive for them. They saw aunt as an authority. 

In the 80’s it was already widely known that some medicines with cis and trans molecules can have vastly different effects. And that for some you should only use cis or trans or disasters could happen. Aunt must have seen this case in her classes, I don’t think this is something one just forgets.

Aunt has forgotten that my girlfriend also had biochemistry 1 in university. There was absolutely no way she could convince us to not take the vaccine.

Aunt would convince others not to take it but she would of course take it for herself.

How can people be like that? This is so deeply evil, toying around with people’s health and even lives just to feel some power over them. I wonder how many others she had tried to convince."	0
"Good news I’ve had HPV since 2011, with the exception of one HPV negative result six months after a LEEP in 2018. My LEEP had unclear margins and I was back to CIN 1 within 1.5 years. I’m 41 and was starting to get scared. Many colposcopies over the years.

 But I tested negative for HPV and no abnormal cells during my annual this year! 

Just sharing for the benefit of anyone else struggling with a persistent case. I didn’t make changes with HPV in mind, but I’ve definitely cut out all smoking (I was only ever a social smoker) and nearly all drinking since having a baby in 2020. Maybe that did it."	1
Hpv? Mid cycle bleeding So I'm 24 F. (With major health anxiety may I add) I've always worried over HPV. I've been sexually active since 16. I've had 3 partners (First time with someone I was seeing, second with a boyfriend I was with for 2 years and currently my boyfriend of 4 years) since the start of 2020 I noticed that I was bleeding in between periods the first time it happened I freaked and said it to the nurse and she said it was likely nothing and did std tests and everything negative. ( I was also on bc since 15 as I was getting heavy periods every 2 weeks) when the mid cycle bleeding started I wasn't on bc I had stopped it a few months prior. I thought maybe it was because I wasn't on anything and also my mom said the same it was possible hormone related. So that was around Feb 2020 and it was happening every month, I was still getting my cycle regular every 28 days. I met my current boyfriend in September 2020 and went back on birth control I'm pretty sure the bleeding stopped and I was like okay I probably just need to be on bc. However due to personal reasons I haven't been on anything since around May 2021. Every month I have the bleeding it is ALWAYS during my ovulation/fertile window and mixed with discharge. I put it down to ovulate bleeding as I do get pain in the ovary too. I'm due my smear in September as I'll be 25 then. (25 is the age in Ireland). I'm so anxious and making myself sick with worry. 	0
"There is hope, please don’t give up. Hello, 
Two years ago i discovered i had hpv and it was devastating. I was filled with self loathing because i hated how disgusting the warts made me feel. I was desperate to get rid of them and tried everything mentioned i here to improve it. Cryotherapy and prescribed cream did nothing for me besides further upsetting me. I exhausted vitamins and zinc and mushrooms and whatever else. This was march 2020 when I first got the warts. In october 2020, they all fell off. I still had one for a while, and I can’t say when it went away but it did. The reason i return back to here was because there aren’t enough success stories on here. I think once people clear their warts they stop checking this reddit and forget about it. I wanted to return to let anyone who needs to hear this that there is a great chance for success of clearing them. There’s no knowing when of if your warts will fall off, but i definitely wish i hadn’t spent so much time hating the situation as i did. I just want people to know that sometimes the best thing you can do is put it out of your mind snd live your life. Do not worry, because stress will only make it worse. I wish everyone on here the best of luck!!

*i can send pictures for anyone willing to message me just to show how sever my warts were for piece of mind"	0
"Really important perspective ""Why would people who care about their children’s health choose to ignore the solid, evidence-based recommendations of the government and the health-care system? The simple answer is because they don’t trust the government or the health-care system. 

Theirs is not an unreasonable position. The American health-care system is opaque and profit-driven. Working in concert with the pharmaceutical industry, it gave us the deadly opioid epidemic. It gives us the highest infant-mortality and the lowest life-expectancy rates among the world’s developed countries—as well as the highest bills.

The solution to under-vaccination lies not in getting the right kind of information and messaging to the “vaccine-hesitant” but in changing the politics of health care. Political agreement is unlikely among partners who do not trust each other, and near impossible when one side is explicitly profiting from the other. The American health-care system is ill-suited to protect public health, because a profit-driven industry cannot serve as the guardian of public good.""

Fainting From Vaccines Hey all! Got my first shot of Pfizer yesterday and feeling fine. However, the guy in front of me at the vaccination site fainted a few minutes after and hit his head on the ground after falling out of his chair. I know it’s a known issue with shots in general that some people may faint and it’s normal, but why don’t they prepare for this? Is there a reason we don’t wear helmets when we get vaccines? Or at least have soft padding on the ground? It look like that fall hurt quite a lot.	0

"Since when did it become a conspiracy theory to want to be educated about a medical decision? I have Multiple Sclerosis. In an MS sub I responded to a post from an unvaccinated person asking about any side effects of the vaccines that other MSers and experienced and if everyone who has MS is vaccinated. I said I'm not vaccinated and explained that my primary reason was because I didn't know anything about the long term effects of the COVID vaccines on people who have an autoimmune disease (I have not been able to find anything out there that addresses that concern).

Welp, apparently I'm the devil, have a low intelligence, and am a conspiracy theorist. All I said was that I didn't have  information about the long term effects of the COVID vaccines on people with autoimmune diseases. How does that make me a conspiracy theorist?

Can anyone point me in the direction of any information about the long term effects of the vaccines on people with MS (or any other autoimmune disease)? I don't know how that informatiom could exist because the vaccines are so new, but I'd love to take a look at any information that is out there."	-1
Cleared HPV!!!! Hey Ladies! I wanted to give someone out there who is dealing with HPV some hope. Let me tell you a little bit about my experience. Back in October of 2020, I went to the Gyno for the first time in 2 years! 2 years, is a long time especially when you are sexually active. I received a Pap smear and 1 month later I was told I tested positive for HPV. I was devastated. My doctor, then told me I had some abnormal cells at the CIN1 & 2 level and we would have to do a colposcopy to confirm. Not knowing a lot about this STI, I immediately did my research. For those of you that have been down this road, you understand how easy it is to fall down a rabbit hole of information. It didn't help. Fast forward after the colposcopy it was confirmed that I would need to have a LEEP. I got 2nd and 3rd opinions of course, and I wanted a new doctor due to personal reasons.  I finally settled with a doctor, I connected with and I felt truly cared. This is maybe 6 months after my initial diagnosis. My new doctor performed another colposcopy and the results showed I have progressed to CIN 2 &3. She suggested it was time for a LEEP. July of 2021, I received my LEEP. It was rough. The process was mentally taxing for me. But I'm here to tell you 6 months later I have been able to clear HPV! If you are scared, I suggest finding a doctor you TRUST. Don't ever feel rushed into making a decision right away unless your life depends on it. Also be honest about how you feel, talk to someone. 90% of it is all mental. You will be fine. I hope this helps someone out there today.	0
"Experiences of COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Hello. My name is Jade and I am a health psychology student at the University of Derby. As part of my MSc programme, I’m recruiting **UK** **women** to take part in research which aims to **explore their experiences of vaccine hesitancy for the COVID-19 vaccine.** This study is being supervised by Dr Jenny Lunt.

Vaccine hesitancy is when someone decides not to have a vaccine. **It also describes people who wait to get a vaccine or those who have had a vaccine yet have questions, doubts or concerns about it.**

Taking part is completely voluntary. It will involve an online interview which may last between **30 minutes to 1 hour**.  Please see the link below for more information, or feel free to share with someone who you think might be interested.

Exhausted by Covid No, you don't have allergies for the first time in your life.  You need a covid test.  No, your chronic disease is not a reason to get a vaccine waiver.  No, I don't have any cough syrup that will make covid better faster.  Yes, the ER wait is long but I can't manage your problem outpatient.  The previous doctor did give you boatloads of addictive meds, but I'm not going to continue that.  I will wean you slowly or you can look for another pill mill.

"HPV 16 reactivation Hi Ladies! I am in the clear since 12 months ago. I was diagnosed 1a1 squamous cell carcinoma in June 22’ via Leep.


Had my first pcr, colpo and pap after the leep in September 22’ all came negative. I had a second leep that month just to be sure there were no more cells left behind. All came clear.
Since then, my quarterly controls have been ok.

I must say that during the months leading the leep and after, I changed my life style (clean diet, supplement, exercise and no stress at all)


I am about to possibly being fired, and I am starting to experience so much stress and nervousness, my heart beats so hard all day long…and I cannot control that feeling. The more nervoussness I get due to my professional situation the worse I get thinking that my inmune system is going to be worsened and then the HPV is going to come back. Can anyone shed light on how the stress levels could affect the reactivation of the HPV?"	1
Hpv as a gay man, what do I do?  So I’m 24 and I’m not exactly someone with erectile dysfunction. I’m wondering if there are any dating apps or forums where I can discuss like horny stuff with like minded people. I can’t do that, with someone who doesn’t have my diagnosis. So I’m just sexually charged with no one to share it with. I’ve tried positive singles , but no luck. Everybody I know there is either long gone from the app, or is so far away there is no point in texting them?? I just wish there were more people I could exist with, who are actually active. I can relate to the anger and the self-esteem issues. Trust me!!! I literally have post about it, doesn’t negate the fact that I’m still young and horny. 	0

4. That drugging kids with SSRIs (which is chemicaly identical to meth) is beneficial even though studies have shown it is detrimental.

"Small pharmaceutical company Inovio needs your help to fight against short selling and many other obstacles and deliver the safest vaccine against Covid-19 Inovio holds a very promising vaccine against Covid-19 with high efficacy, no side effects, adaptability to many strains, and room temperature storage. Inovio is also partnering with Regeneron on producing monoclonal antibodies to treat severe cases of Covid-vaccines. Last but not least, Inovio's vaccines are also very promising to treat the worst cancers such as Glioblastoma or HPV cancer. 

But, Inovio has encountered many obstacles during these last 6 months, regarding its covid-19 vaccine INO-4800:

\- phase 1 trial for delayed for months without any scientific reason, 

\- phase 2/3 trial paused by FDA to get additional information about the device used to inoculate the vaccines (Cellectra) even if it has previously been used in other trials and approved by the equivalent of the FDA in Europe,

\- Inovio is among the top 30 of the most shorted stocks!

Let's fight together for this small company that carries a disruptive DNA technology that should treat cancers and infections with fewer medications and radiations. The world needs a cure for the current pandemic and dreadful cancers. Inovio cannot be delayed much longer to bring the vaccine that we all deserve and its stock cannot be shorted much longer!"	1
"Welcome to /r/HPV - A safe place to go when times are hard v3 Quote from /r/STD - it applies to /r/HPV either:

> The sub is intended to help calm the anxiety that comes with a potential STD infection through education, awareness, and prevention techniques. If you have concerns about your health, please seek a health care provider to address the concerns you have. No subreddit's contents can replace actual medical care from a physician.

**1. INTRODUCTION**

As CDC says:

> Most HPV infections are transient and asymptomatic, causing no symptoms. **More than 90% of new HPV infections, including those caused by high-risk HPV types, clear or become undetectable within 2 years, and clearance usually occurs in the first 6 months after infection.**

As dr Handsfield wrote:

> Probably 25-30% of all sexually active men in North America or Europe are diagnosed at one time or another with genital warts. (...) Going further, at least 90% get HPV at least once, and at any point in time at least 50% of all men and women in their 20s and 30s have active HPV infections.

As /u/beef1020 wrote:

> Humans are infected with over 150 different papillomaviruses. Every type is tropic to some degree, but evidence is that within 5 years of potential exposure 100% of people acquire the infection and clear it quickly afterwards. So most toddlers develop warts on their hands before the age of 5 just like most people are exposed, infected, and clear multiple genital HPV infections within 5 years of sexual debut.

> It is a handful of rare types that appear to have specific genetic traits which create proteins with a strong binding affinity for p53 and Rb which once integrated, over a period of 30+ years, can lead to cancer. From an absolute risk perspective, HPV is benign, everyone in the world get's infected multiple times in their life, and a handful of people will develop serious disease, but with proper screening that disease is almost 100% avoidable.

> When people think about most STIs they are thinking about a disease that is rare among their peer group, or community in general. People need to think of HPV as 100% endemic in Humans, it's everywhere we look from hair follicle samples to skin biopsies. It's not interesting to think about how to avoid it, you can't, which is why control focuses on screening and pre-cancer detection instead of primary prevention like avoidance.

**2. HOW TO KEEP MENTAL HEALTH DURING HPV INFECTION?**

* Remember that you are not alone.

> HPV infections are so common that nearly all men and women will get at least one type of HPV at some point in their lives. Most people never know that they have been infected and may give HPV to a sex partner without knowing it. Nearly 80 million Americans are currently infected with some type of HPV. About 14 million people in the United States become newly infected each year. [source](https://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/stdfact-hpv.htm)

* You are not dirty or worse than other people. Other people just don't know bout their active or previous infections.

* Calm down. Don't stress yourself. Be patient.

> ""Women who reported self-destructive coping strategies, like drinking, smoking cigarettes or taking drugs when stressed, were more likely to develop an active HPV infection,"" (...) ""We also found that women who were depressed or perceived themselves to have lots of stress were more likely to have HPV persistence,"" she said, adding that this study is the first to show these connections between stress and HPV persistence. [source](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160430100243.htm)

* See this video about HPV infections: https://youtu.be/KOz-bNhEHhQ

* Stop reading random pages and sources about HPV. There is lots of misinformation and scary stories. 

* **Stick to reliable websites, for example: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/surv-manual/php/table-of-contents/chapter-5-human-papillomavirus.html), [McGill](https://www.mcgill.ca/traphpv/hpvfacts) or [CHOP](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/questions-answers-about-hpv-and-vaccine)**

* Remember that 64% infections clear within 6 months, 80% within 12 months. 

> When researchers looked at the 10 most prevalent types of HPV, they noted 36% of prevalent infections persisted after six months, 20% persisted to 12 months, 13% persisted to 18 months and 9% persisted to 24 months (95% CI for all). [source](
https://www.healio.com/infectious-disease/stds/news/print/infectious-disease-news/%7Baf692634-fd8f-4598-926d-1847b0ea5e5f%7D/many-hpv-infections-may-clear-quickly-without-treatment)

* Remember that HPV is not for life (edited: in the most cases)

> Most HPV infections in young men and women are transient, lasting no more than one or two years. Usually, the body clears the infection on its own. It is estimated that the infection will persist in only about 1% of women. It is those infections that persist which may lead to cancer. There is some research that suggests that the virus can hide deep in the affected mucosa or skin for several years, below detectable levels. These are called “latent” infections. Having an HPV-positive test followed by an HPV-negative test might mean two different things: that the virus has been completely cleared by the body, or that the level of infection is so small that laboratory tests cannot detect it. Thus, HPV might “reappear” several years after an infection (whether or not it was treated) when the immune system weakens (because of aging, pregnancy, illness, etc.) and then cause lesions. It is unknown what proportion of HPV infections go latent, nor what proportions are truly cleared by the body.

https://mcgill.ca/traphpv/hpvfacts

* If you have CIN then calm down too:

>HPV infection is necessary but not sufficient to develop CIN. More than 90% of infections are spontaneously cleared by the immune system within one year without treatment. Approximately 60% of CIN 1 lesions regress without treatment and less than 1% progress to cancer. However, it is estimated that 5% of CIN 2 and 12% of CIN 3 cases will progress to invasive cancer if untreated. In general, it takes 10 to 20 years for CIN to progress to cancer, allowing a significant time period for detection and treatment. Progression from CIN to cancer requires persistent HPV infection.

* Start eating healthy food.  

>  Previous studies have reported that women with lower intakes of vegetables and fruits as well as vitamins A, C, and E have a higher risk of high grade CIN and CC [9,12]. Accordingly, our study highlighted the protective role of the prudent dietary pattern, a Mediterranean-like diet pattern, which was negatively associated with the risk of CIN2+. [source](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/4/469/htm)

* Don't smoke, don't drink too much, don't do drugs.

> Multiple studies have found both smoking and alcohol use to be significant risk factors of persistent oral and genital HPV infection. It has been proposed that the carcinogens in cigarette smoke increase viral load as well as the likelihood of cancerous transformation of the epithelial cells infected with HPV. [source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319480835_Targeting_Persistent_Human_Papillomavirus_Infection)

* **You don't need to take any supplements to clear the infection.** 

* Daily exercise is a good idea. Check Team Body Project channel on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFjc9H89-RpWuIStDqhO7AQ).

* If you think too much about HPV then focus on something else, do something. Read books? Travel? Watch Netflix? HBO? Cook? Exercise? Play games?

* Read what different doctors say about HPV infections: 

> “HPV is extraordinarily common and is the most common sexually transmitted disease. Almost every sexually active person gets exposed to at least one, if not several, of the 15 carcinogenic viruses,” said Mark Schiffman, MD.

> “If you’ve got HIV, you’ve got HIV, but if you’ve got HPV, you’re about to not have HPV,” Schiffman said. “Nine out of 10 times you don’t have it in two years. Maybe your body suppresses it like chickenpox, maybe it is completely gone, but the result is that you are OK.”

https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/9k1yr0/hpv_disclosure_open_discussion/

* After HPV clearance it's possible to get reinfected with the same strain so if you can then get the vaccine (Gardasil or Gardasil 9)

**3. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (F.A.Q)**

**.: GENERAL QUESTIONS :.**

**Q: Can I upload my photos to /r/HPV?**

No, you can't. There are special subreddits such as /r/DermatologyQuestions /r/STD /r/Warts where you can share your photos. There are also online services like First Derm. Besides of that only a real doctor can diagnose you. Some people think that Fordyce spots, Vestibular papillomatosis, Pearly penile papules or Molluscum are warts.

**Q: Who can diagnose...?**

* Genital warts: dermatologist

* Non-genital warts: dermatologist

* Vaginal warts: gynecologist, dermatologist

* Strange patches, ""single black warts"" etc.: dermatologist

* Internal anal warts: proctologist / colorectal surgeon

* Oral warts, oral HPV: Otolaryngologist / Ear Nose Throat (ENT) doctor

**Q: Does HPV infection mean infidelity?**

> HPV is often shared between partners and can lie dormant for many years; having HPV does not imply infidelity, nor should it necessarily raise concerns about a partner’s health.

**Q: Will I be always contagious?**

Answer by /u/beef1020:

> Once the infection is cleared you are not contagious. If you had an external wart and it went away on it's own you are no longer contagious. If you had the wart frozen off it's best to wait ~6 months to ensure no recurrence, if no recurrence you are not contagious. If you had an HPV+ test during a pap smear, once it's negative you are no longer contagious.

**Q: You wrote that the immune system can handle HPV but on /r/HPV I see cases of people having recurrences for many years. THIS IS A CONTRADICTION!!11111**

Various scenarios are possible with HPV. Person A had an asymptomatic infection. Person B had a symptomatic infection for 2-3 months. Person C had a symptomatic infection for 2-3 years. Person D has adult-onset RRP...

These are not contradictions. Some scenarios are common and some are rare, or very rare. 

In the case of HPV, statistics are on your side, which does not change the fact that this sub can attract rare cases.

**Q: Do condoms give 100% protection?**

Condoms protect only the covered area. You can have HPV infection (asymptomatic and symptomatic) on the whole genital area.

**Q: Why there are many people with persistent HPV infections on /r/HPV?**

Answer by /u/beef1020:

> In terms of clearance, all HPV types clear at essentially the same rate, after adjusting for the competing risk of progression to precancer (which is a rare occurrence for most HPV types). The reason you see so many people on this board with longer infections is selection bias, those that clear early don't come here at the same frequency.

**How about HPV and relationships?**

Here is dr Handsfield's opinion: answer to the question #4882 on Ask The Experts website:

> Over time, almost all HPV infections are suppressed or entirely eradicated by the immune system.

> Our usual advice about genital warts is that people should either abstain with new partners, or advise potential partners of their infection, for 3-6 months after treatment, then not necessary if no recurrence of the wart. These are not science-based guidelines, just a common sense approach of many STD experts.

> But none of this applies to current, ongoing partner(s). You can safely assume regular partners have already been repeatedly exposed, and no need or benefit to stopping contact now. That horse is long out of the barn, no use in closing the door now.

https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21645515.2025.2515753

**Q: Do you know any studies about HPV transmission in couples?**

Yes, you can check this link:

* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2600292/

**Q: Are HPV infections truly cleared?**

> A key uncertainty in the natural history of HPV infection within an individual is whether an HPV infection that becomes undetectable on repeat testing has truly cleared, or whether the virus persists at low, undetectable levels or has entered a latent state. While distinctions between the latter two scenarios are controversial, studies suggest that re-detection of the same HPV type is relatively common, occurring in at least 10–20% of women observed to have “cleared” the virus

**## There's an endless discussion about HPV clearance & latency, so please check this post: ##**

https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/t6rjl9/why_you_shouldnt_worry_about_recurrences_after/

**Q: Why HPV clearance takes so much time?**

> The host’s immune response to HPV infection (humoral immunity, mainly IgG) is usually slow, weak, wane over time, and varied considerably with many women not seroconverting. Generally, close to half of the individuals seroconvert to L1 protein of HPV 16, 18, or 6 within 18 months. (...) Natural infection-elicited antibodies may not provide complete protection to HPV over time. A recent WHO position paper stated that host antibodies, mostly directed against the viral L1 protein, do not necessarily protect against subsequent infection by the same HPV genotype.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32141607

**Q: I’ve heard that 90% of people get rid of the virus themselves and 10% have it for life. Could the 10% be anyone?**

Answer by /u/beef1020:

> First, 10% do not clear in 2 years, but clearance continues after 2 years. In general, the small portion of people who do not clear high risk hpv infections develop precancers and eventually invasive cancer. We do not know why this happens, the specific type has a strong influence, but all other known risk factors have only weak associations. In the absence of progression, all types clear at roughly the same rate.

**Q: If it's really so hard to detect HPV infection/s then how - finally - the immune system does it?**

Answer by /u/beef1020:

> HPV is incredible well adapted both in it's local niche as well as in it's evasion toolkit. Basically, as part of a cells defense against infection/DNA corruption/damage, cells are constantly showing the proteins they are producing to the outside world. Your cell mediated immune system works by going around and monitoring what your cells are doing by looking at what proteins they are showing, like a handshake. When the immune cells detect things they don't recognize they generate a pro-inflammatory cascade that leads to the destruction of the cells and production of antibodies.

> HPV has multiple ways to suppress or limit the expression of it's viral protein production, specifically dependent on what portion of the cellular lifecycle is being driven. So even when the immune cells are actively surveilling the area because of a different infection, HPV or otherwise, the infection can hide. Most infections, after a long enough period of time, shift the portion of the viral DNA that is active, which results in the loss/reduction of this evasion ability.

> It's actually a unanswered question why some infections can continually avoid detection for 20+ years and eventually lead to cancer, as that is the rare outcome as opposed to eventual immune detection and control. Maybe a specific interaction between the variant of HPV a person is infected with and their HLA allele.

**Q: I'm gay. What doctor should I see?**

* Urologist/dermatologist for external genital warts.

* Proctologist for internal genital warts.

* Remember about vaccination and regular anal pap smears.

**Q: Is it possible to get tested? Can men get tested?**

If you are a woman, then you can ask your doctor for a pap smear and HPV test. Besides of that some companies offer HPV testing, however their tests are not approved by FDA. See this quote:

> Many are methods for HPV detection used in cervical cancer screening as well as in the study and management of patients with cytological alterations of the lower genital tract. (...) No HPV test for men has been approved by the FDA, nor has any test been approved for detection of the virus in areas other than the cervix. Many are methods for HPV detection that have shown their usefulness in some of the pathologies associated with male HPV but, despite this, none of them has been approved for man.

[source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31874781)

Answer by /u/beef1020:

> There are no approved tests for men in the US. The PCR based test just need epithelium tissue, the test does not care where that tissue comes from, it can be your anus, your cervix, your finger, your mouth, your nose, your penis, etc. The technology to test men exists, the clinical utility does not.

> No testing is available for men in the US. The reason we do not test men in the US is because the test results are not actionable. HPV testing is not effective as an STD screen, it's used for cancer screening and currently it does not work well in men for cancer screening.

**Q: Can I shave my genital area?**

It's better to trim genital hair than shave. 

**Q: How about hand-to-genital HPV transmission?**

> Clinicians can reassure their patients that HPV transmission is unlikely to occur through hand-to-genital contact. The majority of genital HPV infections are likely to be caused by genital-to-genital sexual transmission.

**Q: What is self-inoculation?**

> Auto-inoculation, or self-inoculation, occurs when a person transfers a disease from one part of their body to another. Self-inoculation frequently happens when someone scratches or rubs a sore and then touches uninfected skin.

https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-selfinnoculation-3132792#

Dr Hook:

> Auto-inoculation is a very, very rare complication of HPV although infections may be spread if someone shaves over a wart or otherwise vigorously and somewhat traumatically inoculates themselves. Auto-inoculation is not something for most person with HPV to worry about. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/w6p02f/ask_the_experts_hpv_vaccine_selfinoculation/

**Q: Can low-risk HPV strains cause carcinomas and HSIL?**

It's rare but possible.

> Although the presence of “low?risk” HPVs, in particular genotypes 6 and 11, have occasionally been reported in various HPV?related anogenital cancers, the overall distribution of these genotypes in the anal canal and perianal tissue may differ to that in the cervix. (...) From these results, we confirm that HPV 6 and 11 can occasionally be associated with high?grade lesion and anal cancer.

**Q: Are there any therapeutic vaccines?**

There aren't any comercially available therapeutic vaccines, however there are some vaccines that showed efficiency in clinical studies:

* MVA E2, intralesional, very effective, tested in Mexico. It's intralesional, so can be used against GWs, CIN and RRP.

* VGX-3100 (Inovio), against HPV 16 & 18,

* INO-3107, another vaccine created by Inovio. Actually it's being tested against Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (HPV 6 and HPV 11).

* PRGN-2009 (HPV+ cancers) and PRGN-2012 (low risk HPV)

* BLS-M07, oral vaccine actually being tested in South Korea. It can be used against high risk HPV.

There are many ongoing clinical trials:

* https://www.dovepress.com/therapeutic-vaccines-for-hpv-associated-malignancies-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-ITT

Besides of that some scientists / dermatologists use intralesional MMR, Candida antigen, BCG, Gardasil, Cervarix vaccines to treat genital and nongenital warts.

**Q: Are 16/18 really more dangerous than other high risk strains?**

Answer by /u/beef1020:

> HPV16 is both the most common and the highest absolute risk HPV type. Of about equal risk is type 33, but it is far less common. One recent study found that for every new infection of HPV33 there are ~10 new HPV16 infections.

> HPV18 is the highest risk type of the next tier of types in terms of absolute risk, it is also fairly common. The main issue with HPV18 is the high proportion of adenocarcinoma it causes, which are hard to detect in a clinical setting, leading increases it's prevalence in cancer cases from well screened populations. So while it's absolute risk is a little lower, it's importance in a screening setting is extremely high.

> Both of these issues make HPV16 and 18 the two most important types in cancer prevention, which is why the first generation of vaccines covered them and why many of the early clinical HPV tests with typing include specific channels for them.

> Great paper showing the absolute risk and the frequency of types in a large prospective cohort in the US:

**Q: Is it safe to get pregnant soon after LEEP procedure?**

It will be better if you will wait at least 12 months.

> Five hundred ninety-six patients met inclusion criteria. Median time from LEEP to pregnancy was significantly shorter for women with an spontaneous abortion (20 months, interquartile range 11.2–40.9 vs. 31 months, interquartile range 18.7–51.2, p-value 0.01), but did not differ for women with a term birth compared to preterm birth. Women with a time interval shorter than 12 months compared to 12 months or more had a significantly increased risk for spontaneous abortion (17.9% vs. 4.6%, aOR 5.6, 95%CI 2.5–12.7).

**Q: Is pap smear a HPV test?**

No. Pap smear checks if there are any abnormal cells. HPV PCR test checks if there are any HPV strains in the selected area (i.e. cervix). Doctors can take samples for pap smear and HPV test during 1 procedure.

See the CDC website:

**Q: Is it possible to test negative for HPV but still have warts / bumps?**

Answer by /u/beef1020:

> When a pap smear is done, cells from your cervix are sampled and evaluated for visual indications of disease (cytology) and for molecular indications of disease (HPV test). Your cytology results indicate no cellular changes, and your negative HPV test confirm that diagnosis. That diagnosis is only true for the anatomical site where the sample was taken from.

> So, if they sampled your cervix, you can still have an HPV infection in your mouth, on your arm, on your hand, or on your labia. None of those infections would be detected on your cervix.

"What causes headaches after COVID vaccination? I'm not asking for a generic and totally non-informative ""oh it's your immune system doing its job"" response. I have a PhD in life science and know about physiology and immunology more than the average joe, but it's not my specialty. I've been vaccinated, I'm not an anti-vaxer, but even if I was (I'm not), none of your business, my question is my question.

I searched google and pubmed for literally 2 hrs to find the answer to my question, and I can't find any information.

I'm especially curious about mRNA vaccines. They get injected into the muscle, the cells there start translating the mRNA and spike protein gets exposed on the membrane and the immune system mounts an attack when then antigen is recognized and destroys those cells. (yes, the cells that display the spike protein are actually getting gobbled up, for anyone who didn't know)

What I am wondering is - what causes the headache? The interleukins? The inflammation of the muscle in general? What is the exact mechanism through which we get a headache after mRNA vaccination against COVID?

**Neutral bots probe political bias on social media**

Social media platforms attempting to curb abuse and misinformation have been accused of political bias. We deploy neutral social bots who start following different news sources on Twitter, and track them to probe distinct biases emerging from platform mechanisms versus user interactions.

We find no strong or consistent evidence of political bias in the news feed. Despite this, the news and information to which U.S. Twitter users are exposed depend strongly on the political leaning of their early connections. The interactions of conservative accounts are skewed toward the right, whereas liberal accounts are exposed to moderate content shifting their experience toward the political center.

**Partisan accounts, especially conservative ones, tend to receive more followers and follow more automated accounts. Conservative accounts also find themselves in denser communities and are exposed to more low-credibility content.**

"HPV Thoughts that help me (24M)

Well you have HPV positive. You have two options: 
1. You learn to live with it. 
2. Eradicate the root problem and you kill yourself. That thought exists, yes. You will have it, very likely. You solve something, no. You cause more problems, yes, it makes more things worse than it fixes.

If you choose option 1. The worst thing you can do is scare yourself. You can regret it, yes. It's of some use, no. You already have it! Now you have to learn to live with that. It's shit, yes. I'm going to have it all my life, yes. You can live with this, yes. It's easy, no. Your life will change, yes. I can cure it, no. There are magic recipes, no. I can treat and contain it, yes.

Your world is going to collapse, your thoughts are going to overwhelm you. Therefore, my advice as soon as you receive the news is to go to the psychologist (I consider it essential) and talk about it a lot, a lot.
At the same time, go to the Gynecology/Urology/Dermatology doctor and start treating it, something you have to know is that although it is something that has a way of treating it, it is not quick and since it is not curable it is not permanent, know this and I repeat, work on it with the psycho
In the long run I think it's not about curing it (because it can't be done) but about living with it in the best way possible, I repeat it's not easy but it can be done, the best solution 
Doctor + Psychologist


One last point to keep in mind

It's easier to deal with it as a man, yes. It is more difficult to deal with it as a woman, yes. It is more dangerous for women than for men, yes.

I expose this first so that you have as a premise, if you are a man and you have it, even if you do not present symptoms, understand that you may be carrying a very harmful weapon both in physical and mental health for women, so take care of the other person and don't think with your dick. The healthiest thing is to comment on the situation, they may reject you, yes. They might be upset, yes. They may distance themselves, yes. I told you it was going to be easy, NO. But if you are a good person, this is preferable to causing harm to another.

This virus is not about finding culprits but about trying (if you want) to cope with it in the best way by making an effort to be better every day.

"I am HPV & CIN 3 FREE!!! In September 2021, when I was 2 months pregnant, my OBGYN performed my first ever Pap test and the results came back NEGATIVE - for HPV & and abnormal cells.

Fast fowards to January 2023, 8 months after my son was born, I did my annual Pap test and the results came back POSITIVE with HPV 16 and abnormal cells in my cervix. My doctor followed up with a colposcopy and the biopsy came back with CIN3. How was that even possible to go from negative to positive to CIN3 that fast in just 15 months? 

My OBGYN quickly referred me to an Oncologist who scheduled me for a LEEP the following month, March 2023. All abnormal cells were removed successfully and further tested for cancerous cells. The results of the biopsy came back with a clear margin (No cancer). Thank you LORD!!! ????

My OBGYN recommended that I come back after 6 months for another colposcopy to keep an eye on things. I did my research and found out that I could take some supplements to boost my immune system which will help fight HPV & also prevent CIN3, other grades of dysplasia (CIN1, CIN2) and cervical cancer.

I started taking 1,000mg of Graviola (Soursop) pills, Indole 3 Cardinol 400mg, DIM 200mg, Immune System booster that contains (Zinc, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Tumeric, Ginger blend and Elderberry) Methyl Folate 400mcg, Methyl B-12 1,000mcg, Vitamin C 1,000mg, Glutathione 1,000mg and Hawaiian Astaxanthin 12mg. 

You don’t have to take every supplement I listed above, about 4-5 of them will clear the virus and dysplasia/ lesions right up and they can all be found on Amazon. My TOP 5 recommendations are Graviola, Methyl Folate, Vitamin C, Methyl B-12 and DIM or (Indole 3 Cardinol)

I took all of the supplements once a day (I alternated), consistenly till my 6 months follow up appointment which was last week, August 7th. I went in for the colposcopy/biopsy and had to wait 7days for my results to come back. Today, August 15th, my doctor called me with the good news that my biopsy results came back and I’m all CLEARED. HPV 16 and CIN3 were both NEGATIVE (no sign of abnormal cells in my cervix)

I have been screaming and over the moon about this good news because at my 6 months follow up  appointment, my OBGYN had mentioned that she was going to refer me back to the Oncologist for a second procedure if the results comes back POSITIVE. And this time,  it was going to be a Cold Knife Conization which is more invasive than LEEP. 

So for my results to come back all negative for HPV 16 & CIN3, I am so grateful to GOD for a clean bill of health. I believe our immune system becomes weak during pregnancy and after childbirth because my first Pap test was negative in 2021 so how I ended up going from negative pap to CIN3 in just 8 months after childbirth is a mystery to me. Glory be to GOD!!! ????

I wanted to share my journey and testimony with those who are going through the same situation and are recommended to have a LEEP, Cold Knife Conization or hysterectomy. If I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't have gone through with the LEEP but I was so scared of it progressing to cancer that I didn't think things through but I know BETTER now. 

If you want to have children in the future, I recommend to take supplements (do your research) and take the homeopathic route. Getting a LEEP or any other recommended procedure only temporarily takes care of the dysplasia/lesions, if you still have HPV, the dysplasia/ lesions will come back and you would be recommended to have another LEEP, CKC or possibly a hysterectomy. 

The goal is to clear the HPV virus entirely then you won't need to worry about cervical dysplasia/lesions or possible cervical cancer or throat cancer from oral sex."	1
"CIN3 with HPV, Lletz treatment 18 months ago, but new symptoms Hi all, I'm 34 years old and had lletz treatment about 18 months ago for CIN3 cells, HPV positive. The lletz treatment was surprisingly fine and everything healed well. It's been a year since I got the results that it was all clear and HPV negative. 

A year on however, I'm having vagina pain, foot pain and back pain. My doctor referred me to the colposcopy clinic when I told him my symptoms this week. With health anxiety and a mum currently dealing with cancer, I'm kind of freaking out at having another thing to worry about. Has anyone had any similar experiences? Is it possible for cells or worse to return so quickly?

"Finally HPV negative! Wow so this journey has been so scary, and unexpected… 

I tested positive for HPV last year with CIN 3 on my cervix. I did a colposcopy, in July, and then got my 2nd HPV vaccine in October. 

The colposcopy caused a large benign cyst to grow on my cervix, so when I went in for my LEEP, my doctor pulled another OB into the room “to get a second opinion.” (Just what you want to hear when you’re wide open. ??)

Anyways, she did not perform the surgery because she was worried about the size of the cyst and was worried it could cause excessive bleeding. So she sent me home and referred me to a cancer center… (that was terrifying…)

So about a week later, I went in to the women’s cancer center here and saw another OBGYN. 

She saw the cyst and ruptured it. (Gross, I know lol) but she told me it was totally normal for people my age to get them. Which was reassuring. 

She performed my LEEP a week later, which was not near as bad as I expected. 

Healing was rough. (The weird smell and lack of sex was not fun.) But at my 2 week check-in, things looked great. 

Anyways, I had my 6 month pap about two weeks ago. And after not so patiently waiting for results, I finally got them back and I am HPV negative!! 

This journey has been such a roller coaster of emotions but also such an eye opening experience when it comes to women’s health/HPV… 

I’m thankful to have been a part of this Reddit group. It’s reassuring to know we’re not alone.

I wish everyone a healthy healing experience too. We all deserve it. ??

"Don't want the vaccine? Fine. But don't talk BS about it if you haven't taken it. I don't give a shit if you don't want to take the vaccine. You should have no valid argument to say bullshit about vaccine side effects. That's like saying that I've never tried pineapple pizza, I can say it tastes like garbage. 

No wonder antivaxxers are more prominent. Did we have a higher % of antivaxxers in the 1950s? No. Because y'all dumbass antivaxxers don't have Twitter/FB/IG to say shit."	1
Yall are stupid-ass white moms in their fourtys. Vaccines prevent diseases and do not cause autism. Even if they did, would you rather have a healthy autistic kid or an almost-dead kid with polio and tetnis? Maybe if they're autistic it's because of their brain-dead parents not vaccinating them. And if you think that vaccines cause homosexuality then you're just a homophobic piece of shit. Maybe do some research instead of going on facebook and reading one article by a 12 year-old. If you did your research, you would see that vaccines are completely safe. Now stop endangering your child and vaccinate them.	1
"is it possible to get hepatitis b vaccine as a single dose? i recently just got a hep b vaccine but as a single dose not the normal 3 dose course

i didn't think it was possible to get a 3 in 1 course, i spoke to my pharmacist and they said that they only did the normal course or this one, so i took the single dose as i needed it for university work experience as the normal course would have taken too long

sorry if its a dumb question"	0
"THE ORAL COVID VACCINE THEY DONT WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT! READ THE DD! Okay guys, I am going to take the time to write this to all day traders, investors, and those who have been affected by coronavirus. Now is your opportunity to take back what you lost. 

This company called vaxart (VXRT) is a company based in the Bay Area who focuses on oral recombinant vaccines, such as influenza, norovirus, hpv, and most importantly at this time, coronavirus. 

The crazy thing is that not many people care to understand science, but if you read the presentation from 3/25/2021, it may help profusely:  https://investors.vaxart.com/static-files/560116e8-db25-42df-865e-0ed57b8d129a

The company released an 8k on February 3rd, 2021, which highlights the Janssen collaboration agreement. This collab agreement let's Janssen (owned by JnJ) use their influenza antigen and put it in vaxart pill. The final sentence reads, ""Upon delivery of the report, Janssen has a three-month option to negotiate an exclusive worldwide license to the Company’s technology encompassing the Janssen antigens. Janssen has not notified the Company whether it will exercise this option."" 3 months is 90 days. 90 days from Feb 3 is May 4th (https://investors.vaxart.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vaxart-enters-research-collaboration-janssen-evaluate-oral)

The pill was put the test against the leading injectable for the flu, sanofis fluzone . Studies showed that even though Sanofis Fluzone had 10x more antibodies, Vaxarts/Janssens flu pill worked 8% better at preventing influenza because of the heavy amount of T-cells and activating mucosal membranes. Oh yeah, this was funded by BARDA also, so the government knows all about them. 
https://investors.vaxart.com/news-releases/news-release-details/results-influenza-challenge-study-published-lancet-infectious

Back to may 3rd...vaxart last week announced that they are having a Stanford University T-cell expert to discuss cross-protection against variants. https://investors.vaxart.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vaxart-host-key-opinion-leader-webinar-importance-t-cell

The NEXT DAY, may 4th, Vaxarts Chief Scientific Officer, Sean Tucker, Ph.D., will present at the upcoming World Vaccine Congress Washington that will be held virtually from May 4-6, 2021. The World Vaccine Congress is the largest, most established meeting dedicated to vaccines. From basic research to commercial manufacture, this one meeting covers the whole vaccine value chain where science, government and manufacturers all come together to create groundbreaking progress. Here is a link of speakers : https://www.terrapinn.com/conference/world-vaccine-congress-washington/speakers.stm

These room temperature stable tablets can be shipped overseas to India and Brazil, and all other spots of the world cheaper, easier, without vaccination sites, without fear of needles, (which accounts for 18% of the population of the US alone.), which enables cross variant protection while activating musocal immunity.

Another benefit is they are environmentally friendly. No need for disposal of hundreds of million plastic syringes. 

There is much more Due diligence you could find, such as googling ""richetti brothers vaxart"", ""lodi&the world s2e1"" <<<< Atwill claiming 1 billion pills by years end, and much much more, but that's enough for now. 

Another important note is that on February 3rd, 2021, vaxart dropped 60% and continued to fall from 25 to 5. This was due to investors knowing about money, not the science. Once they realize they can't compare MRNA technology to their VAAST technology, this thing will BLOW. Example: the influenza studies.

Side note: HUGE MISCONCEPTION. MERCK, PFIZER(pill), RIDGEBACK, REMDESIRIVIR, all those are THERAPEUTICS AND ANTIVIRALS. THEY WORK SYSTEMICALLY. THIS IS A VACCINE. A PREVENTION FROM THE VIRUS ENTERING YOUR SYSTEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. 

Side note 2: their building is connected to Janssen with a skybridge. Literally. AND they've increased their employee headcount by 500% in a year with 34 pending positions on LinkedIn. Once those positions are filled, 825% increase in employees. Since may 2020. https://gyazo.com/0691603a06d2a651847b7751af9bc9ab

"A little disappointed in this community Obviously there has been a *lot* of attention given to the vaccine comments from the church and the reception they are receiving. Some members' shelves are breaking. Despite the sadness that accompanies freshly broken shelves that many of us feel, having suffered that same pain ourselves at one time, I consider people walking away from the church to be an unconditionally good thing and I don't care what the underlying reason is. There's no wrong reason to leave a cult.

But the majority of the posts I've seen here are either outright hostile to people leaving over this or have serious undertones of contempt, as though leaving over this is not a ""good enough"" reason.

I left because I found out there is proof that Joseph didn't translate hieroglyphics. That's not a very good reason, compared with why many of you left. But it was my reason and I'm so glad I left over it and found this community that was very supportive.

To my shame now in looking back, I held up ""Yes on 8"" signs on street corners and argued with my friends - losing many of them permanently - about the meaning and sanctity of marriage. Just one example of how I put my own thoughts of right and wrong (I'm libertarian, couldn't care less about what people do as long as it doesn't harm others) to one side because the church told me to do so.

I wish I had seen then that the church was wrong. I felt it but I buried it down deep. I'm proud of those of you who left over that. That's awesome. 

But that wasn't my reason for leaving. Is my reason lesser? Maybe. But who cares? I'm just happy I'm out and can see the church for what it is and begin deprogramming it out of my life.

To those whose shelves are breaking over the vaccine stuff: Welcome. You're in a good place here on this sub. We've all been where you are and it's so hard. I hope you find peace and truth.

To those who are talking down to people leaving over the vaccine stuff: Please cut it out. It's really not a good look and it's not the way this sub should treat people as they walk away from the church.

EDIT: a lot of you have traded the Mormon cult for the cult of politics/big government and it shows."	0
"need advice  

I have been with my boyfriend for 3 1/2 years. During this whole pandemic, he ended up getting covid from work and giving it to me. We had a pretty mild case. His lungs felt tight, but I had the virus worse than he did. My lungs had more of a feeling of weight on them. This was back in November 2020. My boyfriend's mom is a nurse and occasionally works in the covid unit and has seen some pretty bad things happen even to some younger people. We are both 25. I am against the vaccine because I have seen too many articles about the adverse effects, and I do not think it was tested or has been out long enough. I am not anti-vax.. I am just against it because it's too early and its a new technology.

He mentioned to me about getting the vaccine and how his mom wanted to book an appointment. Of course immediately I reacted badly saying we are young and you dont know the long term effects. At the end of the day, he acted like he wasnt 100% for it and I thought he wasnt going to get it.

BUT 2 days later he tells me he is taking his sister to get it... and the mom works at the hospital so I knew as soon as I heard that...he would most likely being getting it too. He was already on the way about 15 min out. I called him crying hysterically begging him not to get it. He kind of ignored me... acted like he wasnt sure about it (which he said is true) and then after his sister got the shot...he was like F it...and just did it. Even though he wasnt sure 100% and I had just literally begged him. I found out later on that he was the one who had booked the appointment and all of it... but he didnt tell me and instead blamed it on his sister and mother the 2 days before he went to get it.

I am worried about his health long-term... and also having kids..I don't know what the effects are from the vaccine no one does. His next dose is soon... and he still isnt sure about it. It makes me so upset that he knows I am full on really worried about it and so against it... I feel like if the roles were reversed I would respect him and how he felt and not get it ESPECIALLY if i didnt think it was 100% a good thing.

I am not saying I think it will forever be bad, I just think there is not enough information.... Any advice regarding how I should feel?"	-1
"Vaxy Weekly Wrap-Up (say that fast 5x) Get your coffees ladies and gentlemen, and some popcorn. (JJ, Yahoo) 

Not financial fried rice, take it with the grain of salt

*Part 1
Here we go! May, the month we’ve all been waiting for. We have a lot of new people on the board so I’d like to take this opportunity to fill them in as well as add my usual ramblings.
VXRT is in the right place at the right time with the right product. I mean, who is the only person on the planet to spend nearly two decades working on oral vaccines? And who knows more about oral vaccines than anybody else in the world? And who does he work for? That’s right, Sean Tucker is THE MAN when it comes to oral vaccines, and he is the Founder of VXRT. He is the individual primarily responsible for making us a lot of money. And is there anything better in life than making a little coin, other than making a lot of coin? 
Which brings up my favorite post this week (by Paul): “What a glorious day to be alive.” Yes indeed, when you are in the “green,” suddenly the world seems brighter, the heavens part, and all resentments are forgiven. To quote Winnie, there is “nuttin like it.”
If you are new to VaxyNation (get it?) or thinking about climbing aboard, here are some VAXY Facts:
We have the only oral vaccine that is highly efficacious, protects against mutations (to what degree we don’t know yet), AND likely provides immunity for years
VXRT has a distribution deal with Rinani Dynamic in Malaysia 
VXRT’s flu tablet tested at 44% higher efficacy than the leading competitor
The VXRT lobbyist is the brother of Joe Biden’s senior advisor
VXRT has 186M in cash
The US govt has agreed to help VXRT fast-track through trials
Only two companies have ever received NIH funding for vaccines. VXRT is one of them (9x) 
Our new Board member from AstraZeneca worked closely with India to get regulatory approvals and market access
Our new Communications Director was a bigwig in global communication for Merrill Lynch and AIG
Since the beginning of the year, VXRT has gone from 28 employees to 90+ (when all open positions are filled)
Contracts with Kindred Bio and Attwill to produce one billion pills
The VAAST platform, the only Plug-and-Play vaccine platform on the planet. It will be licensed out (think Africa, India, Brazil) and it’s worth billions. BILLIONS!
A full pipeline of products; VXRT is not simply a COVID play 
VXRT is beginning Phase 1b with Norovirus, the second largest killer for children under five years old. Currently, a vaccine for this does not exist.
Pending exclusive worldwide license with Janssen (owned by J&J) for their universal flu tablet
Presentation on Monday from Vaxart and Dr. Mark Davis, a Stanford scientist who has published 400 articles on T-cells
The next day, Sean Tucker presents at The World Vaccine Congress, the largest, most established meeting dedicated to vaccines. All the major players attend, including funders
In a nutshell, what we have is an expert telling the world on Monday that it’s all about T-cells, followed by VXRT showing us that their T-cell counts are higher than other vaccines, and the next day Tucker presenting during a prestigious worldwide conference. BOOM!
We are also waiting on the Janssen deal, which could be a yes, no, or extension. We should also learn on Monday when they begin Phase 2a to dial in the dosage. Finally, the following week on May 10 we will get data from the completion of P1. So you can understand why shorts are a little nervous right now holding over the weekend.
Speculation
P2/3 with subjects in India or Brazil
Already booking orders from counties that are desperate
Partnerships/buyout with Big Pharma
Who will VXRT get for the open Board member seat? Bezos, Musk, Gates, Oprah, Springsteen?
GameStop scenario with massive short squeeze (we are trending bigtime on other sites)
Amazon drone or Zipline partnership to deliver pills to rural nations
NIH funding
Funding from CEPI (global foundation that deals with vaccines and infectious diseases), who has promised 3.5 billion to help get vaccines into impoverished nations. A member of CEPI made a comment recently that they were “Enthusaed by a company that has the capacity to manufacture one billion pills.” I wonder who that is?
Remember, when NVAX received CEPI funding, their SP went from $17 to $43, OWS funding took it to $94, collaboration with SK to $146, P3 data and deals with two countries to $260. When VXRT announces interim data from P2/3, we are going to be in the hundreds because countries are going to be busting down the doors desperate to get the pill. Even though the pill won’t be out until later this year or possibly even early next year, it’s not like the planet is going to be vaccinated anytime soon. Experts agree it’s going to take a few years. And then they have to do it all over again with boosters. 
Interesting comment from Dr. Fauci this week: “We need to help other countries manufacture vaccines.” And who has the only Plug and Play Platform?

*Part 2
We have a new generation of bashers this week who take lying to a new level. For instance, take Timmy, who makes me laugh every day. He likes to eat dinner at Olive Garden, a “classy place.” The other night for dinner he had Alaskan king crabs, Japanese Wagyu beef, Russian caviar, Norwegian veggies, Indian rice and French bread. And he’s been investing for 75 years, so he’s at least 95 years old. And he sold at $24, which was only available for a microsecond. And he drives a Bentley and lives in a beach front mansion. And he’s telling longs to “finally get a job and earn an honest living for once.”
Then he came up with this,”I always ask myself wwjd. And He would not have been too greedy yesterday when this went up over 50%. He would have sold and locked in profits.” 
Thanks for the laughs Timmy. 
By the way, this is not really a summary of the week in technical terms because plenty of longs on this site provide that information. I’m simply a long-term investor with a relatively small position (just north of 30k shares). Today I was mesmerized by the AH action trying to bust through the wall at $11. There were some huge gaps afterward where I was up $10,000 in a second or two. This is why the market and Vaxy is so addictive. What happened this week is just a small precursor of what’s to come.
You may wonder, why hasn’t BP created a vaccine pill? It’s because they can’t. It’s difficult to speed up science, which is why the best that BP can do is to come up with therapeutics. But we have a pill that actually prevents you from getting the virus in the first place. How much is that worth? I don’t know, but it’s a heck of a lot more than $11 a share.
VXRT represents the world’s best chance to reach global herd immunity. They can manufacture their pills 20-30 times faster than Big Pharma can with the injectables, which means in roughly four months’ time they could produce enough pills for everyone on the planet. Imagine that, taking a pill that protects against mutations and provides immunity for years. Going back to a normal life again, going to concerts, sporting events, getting together with friends.
This is a company ready to do some serious damage by disrupting traditional methods of creating vaccines. They are positioning themselves to be the Amazon of vaccines, the world’s most important and successful vaccine manufacturer.
Follow the money. Just wait until we get the Q2 numbers for institutional holders. We are going to see a massive increase.
Also follow the science. We’ve got it and the world will learn about it on Monday and Tuesday.
To those of you who are new to VaxyNation, you don’t know how lucky you are. Many of the longs on this board have been waiting for years for what is about to happen. The Vaxy train is about to leave the station, and many of us are not jumping off until we are well into triple digits. We know what we have. 
In the next few weeks/months, big things are going to happen. Some will come out of nowhere. A company does not triple their workforce and ramp up to produce one billion pills without total confidence in their product and major events going on behind the scenes. I’ve been saying this for months: They know they have the goods. The world will know as well after the two presentations next week. That’s why I’m not expecting a pullback anywhere near what happened in February.
This is our time! You’re either on the Vaxy train or you’re not. If you’re not, get out of our way! 
To quote a famous song from my generation,”You Ain’t Seen Nuthin Yet.”

"Being vaccinated with thr first dose, not sure if I should take another one So I have read a lot of corona ralated subs here, and no matter if you vaccinated or not, the chances that you will get Covid and have mild or strong symptoms, even die, are totally the same. I got my first vaccine couple of days ago, and really after I have read all those sci papers that praise vaccines and on the other side experiences from people here I am not sure if I should take another one... 
If my chances are the same with vaccine or not, why would I bother going to take it.. I am Not smart anymore."	-1

"I have HPV. What do I do now? A super common type of post we get here a LOT is 'I have been diagnosed with HPV. What can I do to help myself?'. This applies to both low risk/wart and high risk diagnoses.

The short version of this post is: 'there's not a lot you can do except wait'. But I wanted to write a more extended post to cover some of the various ideas that are batted around here. Particularly important to me is to counter this mindset that those of us with persistent infections aren't doing enough, or that 'boosting the immune system' is something that's easy to do.

I'm not going to cover prescribed treatments in detail in this post (either wart or abnormal cell removal), because there is already a lot of info in the FAQ about these.

(Not a doc, not a scientist, open to correction if you've got the sources to back it up)

**Sit and wait - is this legit advice?**

If you have been given a diagnosis of cervical infection from a co-tested smear, you may have been asked to go away and come back in 6 months or a year. Some posters feel worried that this approach may be too relaxed.

The reality is that the body's immune system needs to deal with the HPV infection and, in most cases, it will do this on its own. There are a number of studies on HPV 'clearance' (I prefer the term 'immune suppression' as the meaning of clearance is ambiguous; what it means here is that patients test negative via standard PCR testing), e.g. here: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2360183/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2360183/)

'The overall type-specific hrHPV clearance rates at 6 and 18 months were 43% (95% CI 39–47) and 65% (95% CI 60–69).'

So, there is a good chance that your infection will be dealt with over the course of a few months up to a couple of years. However, as this study shows, there is some variance in terms of strain and the degree of cervical abnormalities you have. If you have CIN2 or CIN3, sit and wait is probably not great advice, and certainly for CIN3 you are likely to need treatment (LEEP or LLETZ) to help the body along. CIN1 can usually be left alone for a bit to see if it regresses on its own or not.

When it comes to wart infections, warts may regress on their own ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3390234/#:\~:text=Following%20initial%20clinical%20manifestation%2C%20CA,first%20four%20months%20of%20infection](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3390234/#:~:text=Following%20initial%20clinical%20manifestation%2C%20CA,first%20four%20months%20of%20infection).) but they may also grow in size and number, so it's usually best to seek treatment rather than leave them. Nevertheless, the majority of low risk HPV infections are also suppressed by the immune system within a few months up to a couple of years, just like high risk.

**Boosting the immune system**

Time and time again, people ask 'What can I do to boost my immune system?'. Unfortunately, this is not a simple thing to do. If it were, we would never be sick, and things like Covid wouldn't be a big problem. The human immune system is immensely complex and also varies a lot between individuals. Hence, simply advising someone to 'do more' for their immune system is reductive and sometimes not that helpful.

Of course, basic things like getting enough sleep, not eating a diet composed only of junk food, and not taking/smoking things that harm your body are only going to make you healthier. These are not bad things to do. They just might not solve your HPV for you.

Worried posters sometimes ask 'What if I have one drink? What if I eat one burger?' - there are no hard and fast rules here, and ultimately having cell abnormalities or warts or a persistent infection is **not your fault**.

**Should I make lifestyle changes?**

To follow on from the above: there are very few lifestyle changes proven to help with HPV infection. A key one is **stop smoking**. There are studies showing that smoking can increase persistence in women ([https://www.hcplive.com/view/2007-03\_42](https://www.hcplive.com/view/2007-03_42)) and men ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3253903/#:\~:text=Smoking%20could%20influence%20the%20incidence,in%20increased%20susceptible%20to%20infection](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3253903/#:~:text=Smoking%20could%20influence%20the%20incidence,in%20increased%20susceptible%20to%20infection).) I don't know of any studies done on smoking cannabis (a common query here) so you'll need to make up your own mind on that.

Using **condoms** with a regular partner may be helpful when it comes to cervical infections because it lowers the viral load being rubbed around ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14566832/#:\~:text=Although%20lower%20regression%20rates%20were,lesions%20and%20clearance%20of%20HPV](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14566832/#:~:text=Although%20lower%20regression%20rates%20were,lesions%20and%20clearance%20of%20HPV).).

Eating **fruits and vegetables** may be helpful: [https://moffitt.org/cancers/cervical-cancer/faqs/do-certain-foods-fight-cervical-cancer/#:\~:text=A%20diet%20that%20is%20high,cervical%20cells%20into%20cancerous%20lesions](https://moffitt.org/cancers/cervical-cancer/faqs/do-certain-foods-fight-cervical-cancer/#:~:text=A%20diet%20that%20is%20high,cervical%20cells%20into%20cancerous%20lesions).

Studies on **oral contraceptives** are conflicting - some show a correlation between taking them and lower rates of clearance, and others don't. It's possible that women taking the pill don't use condoms as much, so are exposed to a higher viral load.

This study suggests not using **tampons** but I've not seen this elsewhere so make of it what you will: [https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article/14/5/1149/274947/Modifiable-Risk-Factors-Associated-with-Clearance](https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article/14/5/1149/274947/Modifiable-Risk-Factors-Associated-with-Clearance)

When it comes to genital warts, there's not much literature out there on lifestyle, but probably the findings on smoking, condoms/viral load and vegetables hold true.

**Should I be taking supplements or vitamins?**

It's really tempting to buy a lot of supplements in the search for the magic pill to make everything better. But is there any proof of what works?

The evidence on supplements is limited. Potentially, **B vitamins** might be a good thing for CIN ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4711818/#:\~:text=Folate%20and%20vitamin%20B12%20may,higher%20grades%20of%20CIN%20%2D%20PMC&text=The%20.,government%20websites%20often%20end%20in%20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4711818/#:~:text=Folate%20and%20vitamin%20B12%20may,higher%20grades%20of%20CIN%20%2D%20PMC&text=The%20.,government%20websites%20often%20end%20in%20).). **Probiotics** have been suggested as a helpful supplement to support cervical and vaginal health, but the evidence seems patchy ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7668491/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7668491/)).

**AHCC** is often touted as a miracle cure for HPV. The research is both limited in size and also sponsored by the company that makes AHCC - make of that what you will. See this post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/vmsa2i/ahcc\_phase\_ii\_results\_finally\_published\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/vmsa2i/ahcc_phase_ii_results_finally_published_in/)) for more info. This supplement is quite expensive, but if it makes you feel psychologically better, again it is probably not going to do harm to anything but your wallet, and you may decide the small chance of benefit is worth it. Note that **Papillex** is a similar supplement.

**DIM** is another supplement that some claim will help. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3251847/#!po=0.833333](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3251847/#!po=0.833333) ' The results suggest that short-term DIM supplementation (150?mg?day?1) is well tolerated, but is unlikely to have an effect on cytology or HPV infection. '

For genital warts, it's possible that **Zinc sulfate** may be beneficial ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21352302/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21352302/)), although some studies conflict.

In some countries, antivirals like **inosine pranobex** are prescribed for genital warts and sometimes general HPV infections. This isn't readily available everywhere, which suggests it is also not a cure-all. But you may be able to source it e.g. from Amazon (search on here for tips). Be aware that taking drugs from the internet may be dangerous.

**Can I get any other medications?** In some countries, additional medications may be given. There are some studies suggesting that **Deflagyn** is effective in reducing progression of HPV-related abnormalities ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10299567/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10299567/)). This medication is not yet widely available everywhere.

**Should I get vaccinated?**

Vaccination after infection is not absolutely proven to help with a current infection, but it's possible there may be some positive effect e.g. this recent analysis of the evidence ([https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/wfvtfp/hpv\_vaccine\_after\_removal\_of\_precancerous\_cells/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/wfvtfp/hpv_vaccine_after_removal_of_precancerous_cells/)). Of course, it is proven to protect you against future infection with the included strains, so it's probably a good idea.

**Do I need to dress/wash/behave differently at home?**

No. Genital HPV spreads through significant genital to genital or oral skin contact, i.e. sex. You don't need to behave any differently with your friends or family. You also don't need to do any special washing routine or anything like that. Just live your life normally.

**Psychological wellness**

Sometimes, the biggest toll of HPV is on our mental health. So, whatever you need to do to maintain psychological wellness is important. If this means doing a health regimen, that's great - as long as it doesn't become a harmful obsession. I also think getting therapy or counselling can be a really good way to deal with the stresses of HPV.

If you are feeling suicidal or have other thoughts of harming yourself, please seek emergency support ASAP. HPV is a very, very normal thing to have, and it's also a time-limited active infection. Whilst understandable to feel a range of emotions on diagnosis, this is absolutely not a reason to harm yourself. 

**Important:** Don't post over and over again on Reddit about your suicidal feelings, anxieties, or needing validation. It's fine to post legitimate questions (although they've probably already been answered in the sticky post) but it can be very triggering for others to read distressing posts, and it also won't help you. As above, please seek professional mental health support.

**Conclusion**

One of the toughest aspects of HPV is that there is no easy way round it. There's no silver bullet. You will have to see what happens! Upgrading your habits to be healthier isn't a bad thing and there are a few things that might have a positive impact. But you don't need to go crazy on a wild health routine, and you shouldn't feel downhearted if your infection doesn't go quickly despite your efforts. Do what makes it possible to deal with the psychological impact, within your own cost and happiness limitations."	0
"Discussion! What does everyone think. I don't want to be labeled as an anti-vaxxer, but I have some questions and concerns about vaccines [discussion]

Hey r/conspiracy, I wanted to start a discussion about vaccines. I know this is a touchy topic, and the front page of reddit is very harsh on anybody who questions the validity of vaccines in any way.

I love and believe in science, and my interest in this topic comes only from a place of genuine concern, and trying to earnestly figure out what would be the best thing to do for my future children. I grew up extremely pro-vaccines, but the internet has exposed me to some information that seems like an important part of the discussion.

So I'm laying out some of the information I've seen, and the points they bring up. A lot of this information was collected from other reddit posts (including [this great post](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/aw1dqm/assumptions_i_had_when_i_was_a_provaxxer/) and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/b10ywn/reddits_247_provaccine_circlejerk_isnt_it/eiixxmk/) also) but I've added a few links of my own, and re-arranged some of the information to make it easier to digest.

By re-posting it again here, I'm hoping we can start a conversation about these points. If anybody has any important points they want to include, comment and I'll edit it in. If there is any misinformation mixed in, please help point it out and I'll update the original post with the best info possible. Hopefully we'll all be better informed at the end of this!

**So I want to start off by looking at this Wikipedia article:** [**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical\_human\_experimentation\_in\_the\_United\_States**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States)

Just to remind everybody that, when it comes to the US government's, we are dealing with a convicted criminal who has a history of using these types of tactics for unethical ends, by unethical means:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;[**Unethical human experimentation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation) **in the United States** describes numerous experiments performed on human test subjects in the United States that have been considered [unethical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ethics), and were often performed illegally, without the knowledge, [consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent), or [informed consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent) of the [test subjects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_subject_research). Such tests have occurred throughout American history, but particularly in the 20th century. The experiments include: the exposure of humans to many chemical and biological weapons (including infection with deadly or debilitating diseases), [human radiation experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_radiation_experiments), **injection of toxic and radioactive chemicals**, surgical experiments, interrogation and [torture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture_and_the_United_States) experiments, tests involving mind-altering substances, and a wide variety of others. **Many of these tests were performed on children,**[**\[1\]**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States#cite_note-Against_Their_Will:_The_Secret_History_of_Medical_Experimentation_on_Children_in_Cold_War_America-1) the sick, and mentally disabled individuals, **often under the guise of ""medical treatment"".** In many of the studies, a large portion of the subjects were poor, racial minorities, or prisoners.

&amp;#x200B;

With that said, vaccines get a lot of credit for saving millions lives by killing off major diseases including measles, mumps, whooping cough, etc.

**However, the evidence indicates that 90 percent of those diseases were wiped out by the popularization of sanitation, before the vaccines were developed.**

&gt;*Graham has estimated that Vioxx killed some 60,000 patients--as many people, he points out, as died in the Vietnam War. He says that fundamental problems at the FDA led to those deaths. ""People should turn to Congress and demand a drug safety system that is free from corporate influence--and a distinct center for drug safety.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;*In Graham's eyes, the problem at the FDA is that the same scientists who approve drugs are the ones charged with deciding whether or not they are safe enough to remain on the market when problems crop up. ""There is no feedback or review process to say, 'You guys have made a big mistake,' "" he says.*

**In the early 1980’s, the DPT vaccine was harming and killing people unpredictably** ([https://www.nvic.org/vaccines-and-diseases/whooping-cough/vaccine-injury.aspx](https://www.nvic.org/vaccines-and-diseases/whooping-cough/vaccine-injury.aspx)). Because of this, it was not cost-effective to continue creating new vaccines as there was too much liability.

&amp;#x200B;

**National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act legislation (renders manufactures 100% of any &amp; all liability):**

As a result, today if you are harmed by a vaccine, you cannot sue the vaccine manufacturers. They are the only industry protected from liability by the government. If you try to sue a vaccine company, it goes through a separate federal court and you will be paid out by the tax-payers, not by the vaccine manufacturers.

**IOM safety report on vaccines brings ups safety concerns:**

&gt;*“Although the committee is optimistic that more can and will be known about vaccine safety in the future, the limitations of the currently available peer-reviewed data meant that, more often not, we did not have sufficient scientific information to conclude whether a particular vaccine caused a specific rare adverse event. Where the data were inadequate to reach a scientifically defensible conclusion about causation, the committee specifically chose not to say which way the evidence “leaned,” reasoning that such indications would violate our analytic framework.” - IOM*

**Unlike a nature measles infection, receiving measles vaccines does not create lifelong immunity, effects wane over time:**

&gt;*“When immunity wanes, vaccination has a far more limited impact on the average number of cases. While this observation has clear public-health implications, the dynamic consequences of the interaction between vaccination, waning immunity and boosting are far more striking. For high levels of vaccination (greater than 80%) and moderate levels of waning immunity (greater than 30 years), large-scale epidemic cycles can be induced.”*

**DTP Vaccine increases mortality rate by 5 times:**

DTP was associated with 5-fold higher mortality than being unvaccinated. No prospective study has shown beneficial survival effects of DTP. Unfortunately, DTP is the most widely used vaccine, and the proportion who receives DTP3 is used globally as an indicator of the performance of national vaccination programs. It should be of concern that the effect of routine vaccinations on all-cause mortality was not tested in randomized trials.

&gt;*All currently available evidence suggests that DTP vaccine may kill more children from other causes than it saves from diphtheria, tetanus or pertussis.* Though a vaccine protects children against the target disease it may simultaneously increase susceptibility to unrelated infections.

Does an individual who was infected with covid-19 need to get vaccinated? If yes, why? If no, why not? I'm trying to understand. If I got covid-19 why do I need to take the vaccine? Am I not immune from it at least as long as the antibodies are present? Is there any new antibody the vaccine gives me that I don't get from the infection? Or is this a way for the company to make more money? Or for the doctor to save time and effort to give the vaccine instead of spending the time to explain this to the patient who is asking for help?	0
"Male 25 Years Old, Starting to get sexually active, Do I need HPV Vaccine? Hi Guys, I'm a 25 yo male started getting sexually active and dare I say \*multiple partners\*, at my local govt policy, the funded HPV immunisation is free until 26 yo.

Do you guys reckon I should get it?

Cheers!"	0
"It's a shame I have to explain this like people are 6 years old, but here it is. All cause mortality/morbidity. Net benefit. Net outcome. Overall outcome. Balance of risks and benefits. If the covid vaccine increase a human beings chances of survival or reduces a human beings chances of a health problem occuring over a given time period (say a year, the best measure would be as long as we have available data for and to continue to monitor as time goes on), then that vaccine is a good thing, it does more good than harm, it may still do harm but the harm would be outweighed so much so that the sum of the harm and the benefit STILL creates benefit. Let's use numbers. 0 is your starting point, before you take the vaccine, positive numbers above 0 mean increased chance of survival or reduced chance of health issues, negative numbers below 0 mean decreased chance of survival or increased chance of health issues (of all types, heart issues, neurological issues, paralysis, any issue).

AFTER you take the vaccine, if you stay at 0 for survival and health, then the vaccine did absolutely nothing for you overall. How could this happen? Two ways. One way is that the vaccine increased your chance of surviving covid by +1 but increased your chances of dying of a blood clot or cardiac arrest, which would be -1, as overall, 1+-1 gets you back to 0.  
The other way is that the vaccine just did absolutely nothing, it was completely useless and completely harmless, it was benign and basically you may as well have given yourself a placebo.

If you end up at +1 for survival and health, then the vaccine was a good thing for you (given that there were no alternatives that were even better of course). This could happen even if there was a significant increased risk of blood clot or cardiac arrest, lets say -1, so long as it increased your chances of surviving covid by +2, as overall, -1+2 = +1.

All I am asking for is evidence that when I vaccinate, I am going to go into positive numbers, not negative or nowhere and stay put.

I will only take the vaccine if I can be provided evidence that if I take it, I will end up above 0.00, and my chances of survival or health goes up. I will accept no mortality benefit with a health benefit (avoiding long covid but not death for example), and I will accept mortality benefit with no morbidity benefit. I may even accept a morbidity cost with a mortality benefit as long as it outweighs it. I may also accept a morbidity gain with a mortality cost, as long as that's a substantial benefit like +4 and the mortality cost is negligible or low like -0.01 or -0.03.

I will not accept a morbidity loss and a mortality loss. I will not accept a mortality wash and a morbidity wash (look up net wash if you don't know what that means)."	0

"Talking to parents about vaccines So, don't know if this is the right place for this ( if it isn't, sorry mods, and let me know a better sub to do it on), but let's see how this goes.


 I have moved abroad from my home a few years ago to study in college, and since this whole mess started a few years ago, talking to my parents about current news is an emotional minefield. 

 My dad had always been a bit of a skeptic when it comes to government and news, which helped to give me a healthy ideal of searching for evidence when it comes to most things, but his reaction to COVID and the ensuing lockdown, masks and eventual vaccine, have bordered on paranoid conspiracy.

 My mom is more outspoken about activism then my dad, but in regards to foreign news and general health stuff, she tends to defer to him for ideas.

 As much as I want to be frank with them, I don't feel safe in talking about it and just let them rant about choice and freedom and tyranny and whatnot while just watching and nodding while occasionally saying some neutral annoyance at the whole situation. 

 I have tried having an open dialog before after doing some investigating, but both times, it resulted in a meltdown of yelling, teats and angry shutdowns that lasted a good few days before we could talk again.

 No matter what happens, my dad keeps following groups that constantly repost debunked articles and talking points like the Israel study and the whole bio weapon conspiracy,  and because she trusts him, my mom copies him.

 Ignoring it isn't an option for me, as much as I sometimes wish I could; I am just as hard-headed as my dad about my opinions and about conceding.

 I live next to a neighborhood with a large older senior population, and seeing how they have been affected over the years still haunts me.

 My biggest worry is my younger brother, who is just a few years younger and lives with them. He wants to come live with me abroad, but he doesn't have a job or money of his own, and so he's dependent on them at the moment.

 My dad is adamant about not taking a shot, and my mom hasn't because she follows him. Since he doesn't have a way to get around by himself and my dad refuses to take him because he's young and everything, my brother is also at risk.

 Everyday, I worry about them (both my parents work in the public sector and have frequent contact with other people), and yet I can't even be honest with my family (none of them know I have double dosed and plan on getting the booster).

 The point I'm trying to make on this long dumb rant is what should I do? How do I approach them at this point? Are there points or arguments that I could make that would help them understand where I'm coming from?

No matter what happens, they are my family and they mean the world to me, and I don't want to risk losing them because of this 

 Thank you Reddit for reading this, and any help or ideas are really appreciated."	0
Yall are stupid-ass white moms in their fourtys. Vaccines prevent diseases and do not cause autism. Even if they did, would you rather have a healthy autistic kid or an almost-dead kid with polio and tetnis? Maybe if they're autistic it's because of their brain-dead parents not vaccinating them. And if you think that vaccines cause homosexuality then you're just a homophobic piece of shit. Maybe do some research instead of going on facebook and reading one article by a 12 year-old. If you did your research, you would see that vaccines are completely safe. Now stop endangering your child and vaccinate them.	1
"Welp, it's official After pap, colpo, and LEEP for my AGC-FN findings, I got the call- I have endocervical adenocarcinoma. 

HPV 16 for 12 years and my 2023 pap and colpo. found nothing, only the HPV. So, when Dr's tell you that 'it takes years for cervical cancer to grow', it's a lie.

Next steps are hysterectomy and radiation. Guess I'm off to the Cervical Cancer board now. 

I wish you all the best with your procedures and results and for everyone else- GET YOUR PAPS AND COLPOS!!! I have them ANNUALLY like clockwork and here I am."	0
"My first colposcopy! Hi hi!
So I had my first colposcopy done yesterday after an abnormal pap, and HPV positive! 
I wanted to come in here and share my entire experience because I found myself reading every Reddit post leading up to it and trying to find comfort in other women’s experiences! And if I can help make just one person feel a little less stressed, then mission complete!

I’m 27 years old and had my second Pap smear done and my results came back as HPV positive for other strains other than 16 and 18(which are the cancerous strains). Doctor did a dual stain which means they dye the samples taken at a Pap and if they stain that means there are abnormal changes to the cervix and she wanted me to schedule a colposcopy.

When I found that out, I was freaking out. Started frantically googling EVERYTHING! Well the day of my procedure I was a ball of nerves, would cry periodically and when I got to my appt. I thought it was it for me and I was going to have to get my uterus taken out after they told me I had cancer. I’m clearly a hypochondriac.. 

Before the appt she told me to take 800mg of ibuprofen to help with pain, so you bet I did that! I took it about 45 minutes before my appt!

So as I waited for the doctor to come in I was trying to calm myself down. My BP was 144/85 and HR was 120 because I was so nervous lol.
Anyways, she has me undress, and she put the clear speculum in(I swear that was the worst part). She then began to clean my cervix with the acid(I forgot what it was called) and for me this process did not hurt, but I could feel some pressure. Then she noted there were mild changes at 12 and 6 and then something about mosaicism at 8 o clock. She took a total of three biopsies. Upon my extensive research, I read that the biopsy hurt so bad and some people didn’t feel anything. The pain will vary. For me, I didn’t feel a thing, literally nothing lol. She actually told me this is a good sign because if there is pain there could be a higher degree  of dysplasia! After the biopsies she took one more “biopsy” and it looked like this stick with bristles at the end of it. Again, this did not hurt but I felt a slight cramp, no idea what she did with that stick but when she pulled it out, it was covered in blood.

After the biopsies were done she put this mustardy looking stuff called monsels to help with the bleeding. And that was it. Something I was dreading so much was finally over.

She sent me home with a heat pack and told me that I would be having dark brown or yellow discharge that could resemble tissue paper. I’m on the second day and I had a little bit of yellow discharge that looked identical to the monsels, just a little thicker! I had no cramping after the procedure either, and I think that was help from the 800mg of ibuprofen! 

Now I’m just waiting for my results!
Still a little nervous, but I just need to remind myself it will be okay and a reminder to anyone reading this now dreading their colposcopy- It will be okay!! Even if it hurts the pain will only last a few seconds! You WILL get through it! I recommend bringing a support person with you to hold(squeeze, in my case) their hand!!


Update 1/12: my results came back as CIN2/3. And I need to schedule a leep procedure…. Soo I guess I’ll be doing that and updating this thread again ?? wish me luck

Update 2/14: decided to decline the LEEP procedure because I did a lot of research and yes, I can cut out the dysplasia, but what about the HPV? If I still have HPV I can still get cell changes. So I talked to my doctor and she said we can recheck in 6 months. I’ve been seeing a naturopath and I’m doing something called escharotic treatment. They pretty much apply a salve on your cervix and it affects the tissues that have dysplasia and leaves the good tissues. Along with that treatment which is 2x a week for 15 treatments, I have discontinued birth control pill because estrogen feeds HPV-  taking turkey tail, vitamin D, green tea, DIM, probiotics and folate and completely changed my diet(for the better)I’m on my 5th treatment and I have already noticed a huge difference! The cool thing about escharotic is that the salve that they put on will change the affected tissue a white color, kind of like during colposcopy so you can actually see the dysplasia decreasing!! I posted a photo! The picture on the left is after 5 treatments and the photo on the left is at my first treatment! It feels exactly like a papsmear just lasts a little longer!
You can clearly see there is less cervical dysplasia! I’m so happy and can’t wait for my recheck, I do not recommend this alternative if you are not going to be committed to changing your daily habits, for me, it was a blessing in disguise because I have never been so healthy and really taking care my body and being in tune with myself!

UPDATE June 2,2022.
Everything had cleared up on the surface of the cervix. We are now treating the canal! But holy cow! My cervix looks like a brand new cervix!

UPDATE August 15, 2022
Just got my colposcopy results back, there is stilll some mild dysplasia but, ITS JUST MILD!! Doctor said to keep doing what I’m doing, so I’ll be returning to my naturopath for a few more appointments! So happy!

HPV DYSPLASIA IS CLEARED!!"	0
"Post LEEP. I'm fine after 1 week. So many scary posts here, why? CIN-3 HPV 16 I was recently given results of CIN-3 with HPV 16. I'm writing this because at least 90% of the posts here scared the crap out of me. I'm here to tell you that I have no idea why some of these folks are making this sound SO serious. I think it's very important to take care of and listen to your body of course. However please read below.

I just had a LEEP last Friday. Doctor said ok to have sex after 2 weeks and dont need follow up visit for clearance. 

I had biopsy before the LEEP of course several weeks ago. Now, that procedure was less fun because they don't numb the cervix. Still ok though and was ok after 48 hrs for sex and everything else, as doctor instructed. No complications and only icky part was the coffee ground like discharge and huge scab glob that fell out a day or two after. No pain with sex.

For the LEEP, my result did come back to have pap again in 4-6 months and have in back of my head of hysterectomy. We're hoping it's all clear by then of course.

The only thing I think worth mentioning was I felt a little jittery after from the anesthesia and a slight goofy stomach the day after, but I have a sensitive stomach in general and I had a couple drinks and went out to play a pinball tournament the same day the procedure happened.

I resumed everything normally except I have waited to have sex with my partner as yeah I don't want any infection. I might have him try just the tip tonight though as I literally have no other symptoms. Over the last week there was some discharge and light spotting of course but I haven't felt really any other discomfort. Was more than ok to go back to work and all of that. 

So with all that, I don't know if folks just need to research who is providing the procedure a bit more or what. Please don't be afraid. I literally felt like myself right after the procedure. I hope this helps someone because I've seen way to many posts now like oh I'm waiting 6-8 weeks to even have sex and omg I'm dying and taking a week off work. I know everyone experiences things differently but seriously, I'm concerned for who some of you saw for this procedure. 

Please feel free to message me too, I was SO scared before all of this.

"Post LEEP positive outcome. I know there aren’t always “follow up” posts, or updates.

I don’t remember the exact timeline. I was pregnant with twins when I had my first bad pap. I was positive for HPV-16. We waited until i had the boys then I had a colposcopy done and was confirmed CIN 2-3 in 4 total spots. We had a LEEP done, and since I was done having kids i said to be aggressive. I was ok if the end result was hysterectomy. 

The LEEP came back with not clear margins, but she was hoping that she cauterized enough to get the small amount left. 

4 months later i had a PAP. We showed still positive for HPV 16, but no cancerous cells 

Well i just got my results that i have zero abnormal cells and am HPV free!"	1
"I'd like to be able to have civil discourse, and comment more frequently than every 10 minutes. I have been for a month now, and I am tired of having to not respond to people because of the huge wait being outweighed by the number of replies I get.

This is a discussion page, I'm here to debate, to discuss why I think vaccines are potentially dangerous, why they are potentially not very useful, why measles is not an awful epidemic zombie virus, and why  the first world should no longer rely on vaccines and technology, over education, common sense and sensibility. 

And why people, instead of looking for ways to slowly, efficiently, and without causing more problems, to remove diseases ASAP, to remove them efficiently, and think about the future not just the wants of right now, and to think about whether or not it's really so urgent that we should rush to make vaccines without enough research, without enough testing or without enough knowledge.

Scientists in the field of immunology, still, have little understanding of how it works, and how to utilize it for progression to better health.

And yet we already are arrogant enough to think that we can do everything now, fix it all, and no problems will come with it!

It's all about now now now, me me me, instead of, wait wait, them them them, not just me me me.

The recent trend of the last 50 years has been, technology is the way, it's the answer to everything. Just look at anti depressants, and the opiote crisis, and how anti depressants and long term pain killers actually make things worse for people.

The moon landing, I know was contrived by the cold war, but was it mostly about accomplishing the future, instead of fixing the future.

So, as I discuss here, how to help the future accomplish their now, not accomplish the future, in our now. I would like to have the free speech and freedom to discourse over these important ideas, and having a 10 minute cool down isn't fair.

Let's help the futures now, not do the futures now."	-1
"Vaccine choice I have received both doses of Pfizer's COVID 19.

Back in 2009, I was offered the Anthrax vaccine before going to Iraq. I declined. I judged that there was virtual no chance that I would be exposed to Anthrax in circumstances where the vaccine would be beneficial. I was glad that I had the choice. My colleagues that worked for the Department of Defense didn’t have a choice.

All vaccines are not perfect. And this COVID19 (Pfizer) has had much less testing than any other vaccine I have received. But still, my judgment is the risk is worth it. There should be an individual risk/benefit analysis for all people for all medical treatments. People should not be shamed or ridiculed for asking questions and making their own decisions. Vaccines are like a reverse lottery, there are millions and millions of winners and only a handful of losers. But no one should be forced to take the chance, regardless of the odds.

Vaccine absolutists like to bring up ‘herd immunity’. But there doesn’t seem to be any scientific consensus as to what rate is need for heard immunity. And some of the policy and statements by public health officials do not seem to be based on epidemiological science. 

As we start to consider vaccine ‘requirements’ as we go forward we should remember the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights- “Any preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic medical intervention is only to be carried out with the prior, free and informed consent of the person concerned.” We don’t force people to give blood or bone marrow. We can’t force people into a medical intervention with the justification that it will benefit someone else, like chasing herd immunity.

One small silver-lining of the COVID pandemic is that vaccination records will likely be required for entry into the United States in the future. This will almost completely eliminate the threat of measles in the USA. It always made more sense to take this step rather than trying to bully 100 million school children into getting measles vaccine. Particularly considering that much of the walking around adult population likely does not have effective immunity to measles."	0

"Questions,Who Can I see for an HPV Exposure As a Man, and Is it too Late for Me? My partner and I recently had STD tests done before we had unprotected sex.

To our dismay her Pap-smear came back positive. I just found out last night and I am spiraling.

I did my best to calm her and reassure her that everything will be alright but I did get nauseous and needed air a few times during our conversation.

So far we had oral sex 4 to 5 times and sex with a condom 3 times.

I have an appointment with my general practitioner doctor this Thursday.

I have been trying my best to research this but can anyone answer my questions?

1.) What type of doctor should I see as a man?

2.) Would I have the same strain as her?

3.) Is it too late to get vaccinated? From my understanding there are 20 types.

4.) What tests has anyone have ever done as a male?

5.) Is it more likely I have then I don’t based on the number of times?

7.) I read it is permanent since it is an STD but then I also read it leaves your body from a few months to 10-20 years. Which is true and what do they mean by leave your body? 

8.) I also read that 80% of the population has this. Is that true?

9.) We decided to take a step back for now from the relationship, but how do I go about dating now?

10.) Should I disclose about the potential scenario of having HPV before getting sexually active with any future partners?"	0
How come there is not much information on Russian Vaccinations or use outside the former Soviet States? I saw that in [2009 ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19882901/)they invented a vaccination for [Herpes Simplex Virus](https://www.unboundmedicine.com/medline/citation/19882901/[Vitaherpavac_is_the_first_Russian_herpes_simplex_virus_vaccine_obtained_on_the_Vero_B_continuous_cell_line]_), additionally they have vaccines for tick borne illnesses that we do not see in North America. Getting information about these vaccines, their efficacy is difficult why is this? Is it a gap in translation, Russian authorities fudging numbers/ obscuring data. It seems like some of these vaccines can have benefits in the states, why don't we see them?  	1
"In shock? Stage 4 and only 28 l don't even know where to begin to be honest. I found this subreddit and am hoping its okay to post here lol.

Today I was officially diagnosed with stage 4 that has spread to my lungs. The doctor I saw said I was a rare case where despite a HPV vaccine and me never having sex (I'm asexual) I had cancer.

I only got this far because I had what we thought was like pneumonia and I went to the ER. I have nodules on my lungs with 1 bigger 1. I then had them sent away after a biopsy and they originally came back as not cancer but my pulmonary doctor I saw sent them for further testing and they came back as cancerous which I found out at my obgyn oncology appointment just today. He also said my lymph node was weird but wasnt sure about it or something like that.

The doctor I saw said unfortunately said all we can do is stablize it but curing isnt an option. I asked if im dying and she said yes but wont give me time however the only other person she saw with what I had lived 2 years.

My mom has been crying and my sisters are beside themselves. My brother is only 14 and super close to me and he needs therapy immediately because of this news. We had to tell him as he guessed I had cancer and knew it was bad cuz I am a bad liar apparently lol. My sisters are also going for gene testing because of this.

My family has no cancer history and apparently the obgyn oncology doctor thinks it would have been hard to catch early anyway as most doctors would see I dont have sex and no cancer history which sucks. Maybe if I had went in for more pap smears or something but I had been told by a doc its not needed as im not sexually active years ago and now I am regretting that.

I am hoping to get into what is suppose to be a great cancer center near me as my insurance has been causing issues and I need a few tests to see how bad its spread apparently and then to start what the doctor said was aggressive therapy to stop it. They also want a second opinion and want to do some kinda surgery to get a good look at my cervix n stuff I believe as she said with me never having sex the exam she wanted would be painful

I have not really cried but I assume I will since google nor the doctor gave me very good outcome. I am hoping that because i am young and healthy I will be lucky and respond well to treatment and get as much time as I can.

I just cant believe that the only symptoms i had were shortness of breath and a cough that lead to all this! If I did have any before I and the last doc I Saw missed them. Ive always had irregular periods (think years without 1 or months and irregular bleeding) and I actually had some 'period cramps' which felt exactly like what I would get if I got my period recently but went away with a little ibuprofen or something so I was going to see a gynecology doc before the coughing started its crazy! 

Thank you for reading my long post. I have read some posts here and this seems like a lovely supportive community so I hope ya'll don't mind I posted something serious and tbh depressing."	0
"Nurse practitioner went against what OB/GYN wanted due to my age - is this normal? So my OB/GYN scheduled a colposcopy for me about two months ago when my PAP came back abnormal/high risk/HPV+. I met with her two months ago and she said she wanted to schedule the colposcopy. 

I get there today and immediately the NP states: “I really don’t know why the Doctor wanted to do a colposcopy. You’re 24 (25 in 6 months) and don’t need it. I’d rather not do it, your body will fight it off.” 

Well, I pushed back and said “I’m bleeding after sex and would really prefer to check it out,” to which she replied “Oh, that wasn’t on your chart. All I saw was your age and HPV results, sometimes miscommunication happens. I’ll be with you after I do another procedure.” 

Is it normal for NPs to cancel what the OB/GYN asked for? I had to fight a bit to get it done; I understand her reasoning, but it was weird to me that she reversed the doctor’s decision without consulting either of us. The OB/GYN wasn’t in today.

ETA: I never got the HPV vaccine. I did round two today! :)"	0

Can we achieve herd immunity with HPV? I mean since they don't wanna invent any cures, and they wanna keep us in the loop so why not we just forgo the idea of vaccines and let's just let live?	-1
"My Dad died yesterday of Covid-19. His last FB post was a meme about how stupid vaccines were. I'm just so angry at the lies and deceit surrounding the antivax conspiracies. I pleaded with him all last year to get the vaccine until he asked me to never mention it again. That was Christmas 2021. He went into hospital on new years day, had a heart attack on the 10th of Jan and spent from that day to yesterday in a coma. They finally turned the machines off yesterday after they couldn't get a cognitive response from him. How the FUCK does this make sense? A virus that literally has a vaccine but people choose to lie and say its not good? For what? Because it's not safe? He didn't fucking stand a chance. Covid destroyed him in 10 days. I can't. Make it make sense please somebody.




Edit: Thank you all for your kind words of sympathy and solidarity. I hope none of you here have to go through what we have gone through. I couldn't imagine a worse way of dying."	1

"The Waiting Game Hey everyone, I am looking to see if I can get some insight. Back in July, I had my second abnormal pap smear and tested positive for HPV. They sent me for my second colposcopy. The Dr. who performed it said that there looked to be some concerning looking areas and did 3 biopsies. The biopsies came back inconclusive and they want to 'wait and see' how things are in 6 months.

Well, about a month ago, I started bleeding after sex, random light spotting and cramping that varies in between the feel of ovulation cramps and heavy menstrual cramps. I dont get my period, because of my IUD, but these things are occurring when I wouldn't be on my cycle. I've been absolutely exhausted for weeks now, sometimes falling asleep sitting up. I have been sleeping for 8+ hours only to feel the need to take a nap or that I'm dragging through the day.

This morning I called to set up an appointment to be seen again, because I just feel like something is not right. I did consult Dr.Google and I seem to check off multiple symptom boxes. 

Am I crazy? My fiancé thinks I'm overreacting. I very well may be, but I feel like something isn't right. Any advice to help me get through this waiting game?"	0
"My girlfriend is vaccine hesitant/anti-vaxx My (26F) girlfriend (35F) is vaccine hesitant or anti-vax I guess. I am pro vax and wanna follow cdc guidelines if we have kids one day, she wants to slowly vaccinate until they’re 5 years old. I don’t want to do that I think it’s too risky. Does anyone have any insight on this? Or does anyone have any ideas on trying to sway her in my direction?

Edit: incase there are any misconceptions. I am pro-vaxx and I don’t want to have kids if I can’t follow standard vaccine guidelines.

Is Hpv the worst Std to have ? Is hpv really the worst std to have ? This post is ment to cause no shame or harm to those with other stds. I know some people have a lot reoccurrences of genital warts or the cancer causing kind of hpv but is it really the end? Maybe I’m making this post for reassurance but I’ve had hpv since July 2020 finally got warts treated in may when I noticed something was off and haven’t had any reoccurrences just a terrible OBGYN that isn’t noticing the once’s that have needed more treatment. Sometimes I just wish I didn’t know I had a virus. But every since I have known I have been more proactive about my health and more thoughtful about how dangerous stds can be to your health. When I think about HPV from my perspective all I can think about is what other people think sometimes. I’am physically in no pain and feel pretty optimistic about the future. But I know if I talk about have having warts I know instantly how someone may feel. I know because it’s how I may have felt before getting hpv. I feel like it’s not the worst thing to have caught and happy that this can eventually be one of my least worries. Everyday it doesn’t feel like that but I know by living a healthy and productive life I have beat half the battle. I really have hope that this is not something that I will be ashamed or think about everyday in the future.	0

"Long term back pain after Meningitis B shot ?? I am an 18 year old female and I recieved my first Meningitis B vaccine about 4 months ago. I’ve had on and off extremely dull/achey back pain in my lower middle back ever since then. My main concern is just that its the exact same back pain as when I first got short term symptoms. I’m curious if anyone has experienced this or has any thoughts on what might be going on ?

I’ve never posted on reddit before but I’ve done a lot of googling and can’t find ANYTHING online about long term effects from this vaccine besides “GBS.” 

My immediate short term symptoms were debilitating and I had the worst back pain I’ve ever experienced (this along with nausea, fatigue, restlessness, weight loss, dizzy). I felt like I was going to die for three days but I’ve heard that’s normal.. The only symptom that seems to have stayed is this back pain. 

It’s kind of hard to explain but its this really painful achey feeling and my back feels super compressed ?? It gets pretty bad after standing still for more than 5 minutes and I find myself exhausted every time this happens (like drained of all energy).

I honestly have no idea if this has to do with the vaccine and to be honest I’ve had hip & joint problems before I recieved it so maybe it has to do with that?? 

ALSOO my apologies I didn’t realize I had so much to say about this ??"	0

"Men and Women Engaging in Oral-Vaginal Sex Seem to Have a Higher Risk of Getting Throat Cancer # Throat cancer, particularly HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer, has been on the rise in both men and women. HPV (human papillomavirus) is well-documented as a cause of cancers such as cervical and anal cancer, but its role in oropharyngeal cancer is increasingly gaining attention. While this virus can be transmitted through vaginal, anal, or oral sex, the connection between oral-vaginal sex and throat cancer is particularly relevant for women. This article will discuss how HPV spreads, its impact on cancer rates in both heterosexual and lesbian women, and the importance of HPV vaccination.

# The Sexual Revolution and Changing Behaviors

With the sexual revolution of the 1970s, sexual behaviors such as **oral sex** became more normalized. This shift in behavior led to increased exposure to **HPV-16**, the most common strain linked to **oropharyngeal cancers**. HPV is transmitted through **skin-to-skin contact** during sexual activity, including **oral-vaginal contact**. Contrary to popular belief, it is not transmitted via bodily fluids like vaginal secretions or semen, but rather through direct contact with infected skin or mucous membranes.

Men were initially more affected by **HPV-related throat cancer**, as they engaged more frequently in **oral-vaginal sex** with female partners. However, as **oral-genital practices** have become more widespread among women, particularly in **lesbian and bisexual populations**, their cancer rates have also risen?.

# Lesbian Women and Higher Rates of Oropharyngeal Cancer

Recent research has shown that **lesbian women** have a higher incidence of **oropharyngeal cancer** compared to heterosexual women, likely due to increased rates of **oral-vaginal sex**. Studies by **Boehmer (2014)** and **Quinn (2015)** confirm that women in same-sex relationships tend to engage in **oral-vaginal contact** more frequently than their heterosexual counterparts. This type of contact increases the risk of **HPV transmission**, particularly if multiple partners are involved?.

Unlike heterosexual women, who are more likely to engage in vaginal or anal sex with male partners, **lesbian and bisexual women** are more frequently exposed to **HPV** through oral-genital contact. The higher incidence of **HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer** among this group highlights the need for targeted education on **HPV prevention** and the importance of **HPV vaccination**?.

# HPV Transmission and Cancer Risk

**HPV** is a virus that thrives in areas with **mucous membranes**, such as the genitals and the throat. It is not transmitted through kissing or casual contact but requires direct skin contact with an infected person during sexual activities like **oral-vaginal sex**. This skin-to-skin transmission makes sexual behaviors like **cunnilingus** a significant risk factor for **HPV-related cancers**, particularly among women who engage in oral sex with other women.

# Importance of HPV Vaccination

The **HPV vaccine**, particularly **Gardasil**, offers protection against the high-risk strains of **HPV**, including **HPV-16**, which is responsible for many cases of throat cancer. Although the vaccine was initially introduced to prevent **cervical cancer**, it has been shown to protect against other **HPV-related cancers**, including **oropharyngeal cancer**. Research suggests that **vaccination programs** aimed at both men and women, regardless of their sexual orientation, can significantly reduce the incidence of **HPV-related cancers**?.

# Final Thoughts

Both men and women who engage in **oral-vaginal sex** are at an increased risk for developing **HPV-related throat cancer** due to **skin-to-skin contact** with infected genital areas. Lesbian and bisexual women, in particular, face elevated risks due to the high rates of **oral-vaginal contact** in these populations. Promoting **HPV vaccination** for everyone, especially high-risk groups, is crucial for preventing the spread of **HPV** and reducing the incidence of **HPV-related cancers**.

Time to Come together You couldn’t ask for a better time to add more. The shorties are only shorting themselves in the long run. Vaxart will be huge. Positive results - herd immunity - pill form not needles- company adding more employees growing bigger by the minute. If I was shorting this company I would look into the future at what was going to be an explosion of healing from a company who has a cure for all new variants that are coming out. Vaxart will be the go to Pill  and booster that all other companies will seek out and recommend. If Biden did anything with the patents he would work to save VaXart’s and have Moderna - JnJ etc.  come together and speed VaXart’s completion process. Vaxart has the cure and it’s been discussed in the conference at Washington. Something else is holding this back not to have sped through like all the other vaccines out there that are given by needles. Big pharmaceutical companies aren’t working together it seems. To cure this all over the world we need to come together. Not give up our patents but aid in finishing the cure and get it out to the World	0
HPV help me Hello, i´ve diagnosed with HPV the last month, I had 3 warts in the exterior part of my asshole and one on my dick, (sorry for the language btw) so the doctor used laser to remove them, and everything is cool, but today I decided to revise my anus, so I decided to stick my finger inside it just to find out that I think it completely full of warts and now I'm scared, what im gonna do, and I just want this to be over, any advise?	0

"Response to Yesterday's Admin Post Yesterday, over a thousand communities on Reddit made posts to their subreddits, calling for Reddit to take action against harmful misinformation on their site. These posts collectively gathered hundreds of thousands of upvotes, with users showing their support in the comments, and several large media outlets picking it up. Subsequently the admins posted a response to /r/Announcements, in which they stated that this misinformation would be allowed on their site, and that they will continue to action communities that violate their sitewide rules, including encouraging fake vaccine cards & ""encouraging harm"". They finished the announcement with a thinly veiled threat of punishing moderators who have participated in this protest, if it continues. The post was immediately locked, making it impossible to directly respond to.

This statement from the admins is hypocritical, dishonest, and misrepresentative of the situation on their site. They are portraying the misinformation as simply discussion that criticises the majority opinion, when it is far more than that: It is discussion that actively advises against government guidelines, opting to follow disproven studies and anecdotal evidence. As stated in our original letter, this type of misinformation is dangerous. The admins are pretending like it is not. As redditors, we should come together against this harmful propaganda.

Reddit's CEO /u/spez is claiming that the admins will take action on communities that ""encourage harm"", while allowing subreddits that advocate not taking an FDA-approved vaccine in favor of taking unapproved drugs, the effects of which have not been studied. Most notably is Ivermectin, a drug used to treat parasites and that the FDA has explicitly advised against using for Covid is often recommended by antivaxx subreddits, most notably r/Ivermectin. This type of misinformation is actively endangering people. The admins are simply sticking their head in the sand, and refusing to take any responsibility for the damage that their inaction is causing.  

Until Reddit takes action, we will continue to speak out against subreddits which exist solely to spread medical disinformation.


# Here's how you can help: When you see antivaxx comments or submissions report them to the admins using this link:

"Disclosed gw to the most perfect girl I’ve ever met As the title states, I disclosed gw to the most perfect girl I’ve ever met. She’s a medical student so she was well-informed and understood more about it than me in a lot of ways. I kinda of did a bad job of introducing the subject because she said the worst part was that I scared her with the “i need to talk to you about something.” Her response was, I kid you not, “HPV is the common cold of stds it’s no big deal and I don’t mind.” 

Haven’t felt this happy in a really long time and I’m so glad I made the decision to talk to her because I never would have been able to live with myself if I hurt her.

"6 month follow up Wondering if anyone can help me interpret results please. I had my 6 month follow-up and got results (which are super positive) but say “high risk HPV not detected, no cytology”. 

I read that as there is evidence of HPV, but not high risk (so assuming I must have had a mix of low risk and high risk to get diagnosed). 

I also don’t know if “no cytology” means not tested for cell changed because no HPV, or no cell changes? There was no further context. Seems strange they wouldn’t test for cell changes given I was diagnosed previously with SCC.

"Anti vax in the family I also posted this on  r/AntiVaxxers I apologize if this is coming off as spam, I did not know which thread would be the most appropriate to post on, so I have also posted my short rant here.

My sister came into town, she is unvaxxed and convinced that her natural immunities can take care of anything. My mom was begging me to come over and see her. This was a very hard no. My mom is convinced that I am over reacting. I sent her a bunch of articles about what the rest of the rational world already knows. She told me that you cant trust medical facilities, because they are a business making a profit. And they want to push vaccines to make $. COVID VACCINES ARE FREE TO THE PUBLIC. I LITERALLY work in medical billing, so I know how hospitals made money from medical incidents and claims, and billing the patient is the last thing that we want to do.

My mom and sister cannot recognize how selfish my sister is by not getting the vaccine. That we all need to be team players and get the shot. It's not just about your own health, it's about everyone elses. And my mom can't be bothered to learn how to find information from a reputable source.

"on the fence about the covid shot. would like first hand input on side effects. **Update**: sorry not sure about the format on updates but I got the first dose yesterday 10 am. The injection hurt and my arm still hurts but i'm afraid of needles and was probably tense or moving. no other side effects to report. no hormone shifts or suicidal thoughts. I'll keep you updated if anything changes and make another update after my second dose. 

&#x200B;

**Original pos**t:

I (32 f) have always been very sensitive to medications. I'm really lost because I can't find official studies on the side effects people experience with the covid vaccine I am seeing a lot of opinions but not a lot in the way of facts. I want to get vaccinated but i'm afraid that it could be a mistake. When I get my period I become depressed. When I took birth control I became so depressed I attempted suicide. I am VERY sensitive to hormone fluxuations. So I guess what I want to know is those who got the shot what side effects did you experience if any? what shot did you get? and how long did any side effects last? I would also appreciate if someone had links to official data (not parroted from a news source but something from an actual scientist.) I am in no way against vaccines I just want to be able to give informed consent if I move forward and i'm really worried i'm going to be negatively affected. I want to move forward with this but I don't want to experience suicidal depression again I have kids not it's not just me."	1
Need for vaccine? Maybe this is a stupid question, and I am not an anti-vaxer, but I am skeptical about this vaccine. My question, which none of my doctor friends can answer (some of whom have even refused the vaccine), is: if my risk of dying from COVID-19 is 0.0007% and my risk of being admitted to hospital is 0.0209%, why is the vaccine necessary? The stats for adverse reactions to the vaccine are higher than that, although of course still very low. Also, why is it, if the stats are so low, the media would have us believe that young people with no existing conditions are dying all the time of COVID-19. Surely the stats just don't back that narrative up?	-1
"HPV-12 positive pap smear results I’m (25F) freaking out about a recent test result from my recent pap.

Now, I am currently freaking out. I’ve only ever slept with three people in my life. The current partner I am with is the third one… I get checked up regularly and never had this come up. 

He and I slept together unprotected the first time last month, can I conclude I got it from him? All the info online is extremely confusing I don’t know what to do/make of this??"	-1
"Vaccination causing me to be extra sensitive to allergies? I recently had to get the varicella vaccination for school. And had no reaction to it, but I realized I kept ""getting sick"" every day and finally realized I was allergic to my soap fragrance. But I've always been allergic to strong fragrances before and generally only floral scents. And it seemed odd for me to suddenly become more allergic. But I chucked all the soap and replaced it with scentless and I thought everything was fine. But I then realized without the constant sneezing from the soap as a factor, that everything I eat makes me feel sick as well and also gives me small hives after eating (I thought the soap was giving me hives). But my diet hasn't changed at all. 

I have autoimmune problems, so I wonder if that's a factor? I had an allergic reaction to the hep b vaccine 2 years ago and it caused my eczema to flare up and my thyroid organ to completely die (I have graves autoimmune thyroid disease since I was 17) and I recall back then I got hives to everything I ate as well. 

Is there any research on vaccines and autoimmune diseases? And if its the cause of this. Will it eventually go away because I'm pretty afraid of eating atm. Is there anything recommended to eat if everything makes me sick? Sick as in hives, sneezing, and nauseated/bloated/my intestines feel bothered.

For info my diet is usually: tofu, beans, rice, quinoa,  berries, cereal, some veggies like bok choy and lettuce, potatoes, bread, noodles, chips and salsa, etc. I'm vegetarianish and have been for 5 years."	-1
"My Cone Biopsy Experience I wanted to come on here and share my experience in hopes it will help someone going through the same thing as me. I constantly have come on Reddit myself to get through some of the toughest times during all of this. This community has helped me learn so much since all of this started for me and I’m glad to be here and hope to be helpful to someone. So with that said, I wanted to mainly share my experience with the cone biopsy I just had a day ago as I feel like a lot of this community gets a LEEP instead and there’s very little information on here about a cone biopsy which is a slightly bigger more invasive procedure. 

In early February of this year I got the results to my Pap Smear and they were abnormal.

Back story, I have gotten abnormal results ever since I got my first pap when I was 22 yrs old with suspected high risk HPV since I never had warts of any kind. At the time, my doctor said there was nothing to do but keep repeating the test every 3 years or so. After another abnormal Pap smear at 29 yrs old and while I was pregnant, I ended up having my first colposcopy. The experience was not great and in the mist of it all my doctor never followed up with the results of said colposcopy and I went on to give birth assuming that if my excellent OBGYN didn’t say anything it meant the colposcopy came back fine and I didn’t have to follow up.

Fast forward to now at 34 yrs old, my Pap smear was abnormal once again with ASCUS (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance) and finally confirmed high risk HPV 16- the kind of strain that causes cancer. My new gynecologist immediately asked me to come in for a colposcopy and I did. This time the colposcopy was even more uncomfortable than the first one while I was pregnant. The speculum destroyed me. It hurt so much that when the doctor took the biopsy I didn’t feel anything as I was so consumed with the pain I felt from the speculum. 

When they called me to come in “right away” for the results of the colposcopy I knew it was bad. I cried all night. At the appointment I was told I had high grade precancerous cells or CIN3 in my cervix and my endo cervix and they could not rule out invasive squamous cell carcinoma, CANCER. To say I was devastated is to put it lightly. I then was referred to a gyn oncologist whom would discuss the next steps with me.

I did not waste anytime to see the gyn oncologist. At my appointment she explained to me they usually treat CIN with LEEP but because my case cannot rule out invasive cancer she wanted to do a cone biopsy. This is when they cut a cone shape piece from your cervix. The hopes of this is that in that chunk of your cervix they cut out during the  procedure they can get all of the precancerous cells out. And if there is invasive cancer, they hope the tumor is in that piece as well that way you can get rid of it all.

So yesterday I went to get this cone biopsy. I have been anxious about it all. I have cried. I have thought about all the pain I would feel after the procedure. I have thought about all the horrors that can happen during anesthesia. Will I wake up? Will I be able to have kids after this? Will I be able to tolerate the pain? Do I have cancer? Will this cure me? Everything! 

Well, I don’t have all of the answers to my questions right now. The piece of my cervix that was removed has to be reviewed by the pathologist. I’m hoping it comes back with no cancer or if there was cancer that it has all been removed. 

The cone biopsy procedure it self was done in an OR which was intimidating but cool at the same time. The anesthesia was wonderful and I have not had any side effects. No throwing up. Just slight nausea that has gone away. The pain down there is tolerable, very sore but I know it will pass. I can’t say much about the bleeding as I also have my period so it’s hard to tell what is what.

For anyone that needs to know, my symptoms before being diagnosed with CIN3 have been spontaneous spotting, or brown discharge with what I feel is a bad smell. Spotting after sex. Delayed or missed periods. And a heavier period when it does come. I have also been told I have PCOS so again, it’s hard to know what symptoms are being caused by what. 

I hope this was helpful to someone. I hope this was a reminder to not skip your Pap smears. And to not fear the cone biopsy. If I did it, so can anyone else as I am the biggest scary cat of them all. May we all get through these difficult times together!"	0
"Got the Pfizer vaccine?? Vaccine Facts (Pfizer):
1. It’s mRNA, not a small dose of COVID - The vaccine is basically sending a messenger to tell your body to produce proteins that will destroy COVID-19 as the virus tries to enter your body.

2. mRNA is located outside the nucleus of your cells (in the cytoplasm where it will be translated into protein), so no, it will not alter your DNA or ?? code.

3. It was tested on 44,000+ participants in a double blinded placebo study. Half of the patients received the vaccine, other half received the placebo. 

4. ~95% efficacy rate. Effective rate we’ll find in due time. The ~95% efficacy rate came from the results of the phase 3 trial in which 162 placebo recipients got infected with COVID-19 vs. the 8 vaccine recipients who got infected (out of 22,000+ participants from each group). If interested, DM me for the math to how pfizer got to ~95% efficacy with those numbers.

5. The vaccine is named BNT162b2 and will be given in 2???? doses 21 days apart. Make sure to take the 2nd dose to achieve & maintain the ~95% efficacy rate. The first dose will prime your body to create the spike proteins needed to destroy the anatomy of the corona virus ??. The second dose will build the army of spike proteins to keep you protected. The length of time the 2 doses will protect against COVID-19 is to be determined. The participants from March 2020 are still protected at the ~95% efficacy rate, so it is promising.

Reasons why you don’t want the vaccine:
1. Speed of approval - this has been the fastest vaccine ever produced in the history of mankind. 
Ans: This is the 1st mRNA vaccine to be produced by intelligent scientists, doctors, and highly advanced technology. Speed doesn’t mean less efficient, we should realize how much science has advanced.

2. Long term effects - It is too soon to know the long term effects of this vaccine.
Ans: mRNA is fragile and will disintegrate in your body if you don’t keep it going. Every drug we take has side effects. Pfizer also makes viagra, a side effect being an inability to differentiate between the colors green and blue??.

3. Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) - will the vaccine give me GBS?
Ans: There is no evidence to link GBS to the mRNA vaccine. The ratio of people who received the vaccine and have GBS is consistent with the yearly ratio of GBS incidence in the United States.

4. Government- Can’t trust them.
Ans: True. Especially for people of color, I totally understand. But we also have to focus on how many intellectuals?? and advancements in tech it took to bring forth this vaccine. I feel more comfortable when I think about the intellectuals. This vaccine would not be here if it wasn’t for them. Government=Politics and its understandable if they are not to be trusted. But intellectuals=science and it is amazing that we even have this vaccine available, Dr. Fauci approved??.

5. 44,000 participants - is this enough to push the vaccine to the public?
Ans: Hats off to these brave people ??. Especially since they were double blinded with either the vaccine or placebo. There are a lot more people now who have taken the vaccine. Few have gotten anaphylactic shock, most had a sore arm. If side effects worry you, stop taking other drugs you take either by recreation or prescription???????. 

Who shouldn’t take the vaccine:
1. If you’re under 16 yrs of age
2. If you have any allergies to the Pfizer vaccine components (see link below)
https://www.fda.gov/media/144413/download 

Take with caution if:
1. You’re pregnant or planning to be pregnant
2. Have allergies to other vaccines
3. Take immunosuppressants or you are immunocompromised.
Of course speak with your doctor if you have concerning underlying medical conditions.

Don’t take the vaccine if you currently have COVID. If you had COVID or you are over the quarantine period, then yes - take the vaccine. Your antibodies will help you for only ~90days if you recovered from the virus, according to present studies. 

Why you should take the vaccine:

Benefits outweigh risks. Simple as that.

We are all probably desensitized by now but the deaths and infection rate is staggering (This is probably the only fact that has been consistent through our battle with this virus, consider all the changes with your hospital/CDC/media etc.)
Take a look: https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html
Patients are on multiple forms of life support, bleeding out from every orifice of their body, unable to breathe, unable to move due to fever and body aches. If you didn’t have someone you really loved in the hospital, you don’t know what it’s like. No visitors, maximum isolation, loneliness and delay of care is expected as we are all trying to protect ourselves from this microscopic organism. 
Woohoo for you if you were asymptomatic with COVID, you don’t know what long term effects it will have on you either.

With all said,
Do humanity a favor, take the vaccine.

Ps. Of course you can make you’re own decision, this is ????:)

How to get HPV vaccine after moving out from antivax parents? So I am 19 years old and I've moved out of my antivax parent's house. They pulled me out of school in 7th grade when all the students were getting the HPV vaccine and I did not get one. Needless to say I am at high risk now and I've been looking to get it but I can't afford 650$. I live in Canada and it is free for people under 15 years old to get it in or outside of school. Are there any programs to help people like me to maybe catch up on my immunizations a little cheaper if not free? Thank you very much!	0
"Vaccine in wrong place? I just got my flu and Covid vaccines and the nurse put them much closer to the armpit than I'm used to - I'm used to the outer arm, armpit level, but on the side of my arm.  Is it going to be effective here?  If not, do I need to get it re-done? Image:  Arrow shows where the nurse put it vs. where I'm used to (gray shaded area).

"HPV positive diagnosis - what will help? 
A couple of weeks ago I received my screening results back stating that I am HPV positive with no abnormal cells. This was a huge shock and instantly made me feel depressed. Having read that anxiety and depression can increase the risks, I am trying to now be more positive. I’m 30, female, and so I’m past the early twenties phase where it is most likely to clear up.

I have no idea who I could’ve got it from - have been with my current partner for over 2 years, and before him I’ve had multiple partners and haven’t always practised safe sex. The first few days I was focusing on trying to pinpoint exactly when I could’ve gotten it but of course that will always be a mystery. It is possible I may have had it for longer than 2 years.

At the time of being tested, I had stopped taking my vitamins and was very stressed. My nutrition also wasn’t great. However I have always exercised at least 3 times a week and am a healthy weight. I have no other ailments. Since seeing the results, I have started taking all my vitamins again and have stopped drinking alcohol...I only ever used to drink a few glasses of wine a month though. I am also focusing on incorporating more fruit and veg in to my diet, as well as slowly moving to a fully vegetarian diet. 

I hope that this all helps me. I wondered if anyone could advise me on further steps I could take to help eliminate HPV. Also hoping this thread may be able to help others in a similar boat.. thank you"	0

"Peter McCullough & Co did not “establish a mechanistic framework” for mRNA vaccine harm. [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027869152200206X](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027869152200206X)

McCullough recently published a paper in “Food and Chemical Toxicology” that posits biological mechanisms underlying purported innate immune suppression and harm from SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination, using VAERs to support their hypotheses of vaccine relatedness of noted pathologies.

This paper proposes that distinct from COVID infection, mRNA vaccines suppress type I IFN leading to a cascade of deleterious downstream effects that lead to various pathologies they associate with vaccination based on VAERs report, claiming to “establish a mechanistic framework”.

This long review article presents many details about various biological pathways, but their links to mRNA vaccines are almost wholly speculative.  In some cases, they link to other vaccines, old mRNA technology, or COVID-19 infection, but are not directly linked to mRNA vaccines.

In fact, so much of their evidence is from papers on severe COVID-19 infections, not vaccination, much content in this article might be better suited to a paper pointing out potential downstream dangers of severe COVID infections rather than raising alarm about mRNA vaccination.

A number of places in the article seem to make stronger statements linking mRNA vaccines to some of these processes, but they self-cite a previous review article by senior author McCullough and do not reference any primary biological research making these connections.

They suggest connections of these mechanisms to various anecdotal case reports for herpes zoster reactivation, liver damage, optic neuropathy, T cell lymphoma progression, Hepatitis C reactivation, events not yet confirmed to be related to mRNA vaccination.

The paper amounts to laying out a series of hypotheses about mechanisms of harm that may come from mRNA vaccines.  Hypothesis generation is a valuable exercise, including in this context of understanding downstream biological effects of vaccination that might induce harm.

However, not all hypotheses are equally justified.  Some are well-girded in direct evidence from relevant studies, while others are more speculative and extrapolate principles from other settings, e.g. SARS-CoV-2 infections or other injected vaccines, as done here.

Indeed the speculative nature of their exploration is implicitly acknowledged by the authors in their choice of wording throughout, including “is plausible”,“one can speculate”,“might be a mechanism”,“one can hypothesize”,“it appears”, “we expect”, “could eventually lead to”, etc.

It seems that rather than “establish a mechanistic framework”, this paper simply lays out speculative mechanistic hypotheses with little direct connection to mRNA vaccines.  Hypotheses to validate, not principles to assume true unless disproven, as their conclusion implies.

""*We call on the public health institutions to demonstrate, with evidence, why the issues discussed in this paper are not relevant to public health, or to acknowledge that they are and to act accordingly.*""

Their conclusion uses the classic “shifting the burden” trick, presuming that it is the responsibility of the scientific community to disprove their hypotheses rather than their responsibility to prove it.   This tactic has been common in the pandemic.

The entire last part of the paper presents results from VAERs attempting to “strengthen” a causal link between mRNA vaccinations and broad classes of pathologies, including nerve inflammation, heart disorders, liver disease, thrombosis, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer.

Their case for causation is driven by their claim that the mechanisms discussed in this paper represent “causal pathways”, the fact that most VAERs reports occur soon after infection, and that the vast majority of VAERs reports in 2021 are from COVID, not other vaccines.

""*In mining VAERS for ‘signals’ that might indicate adverse reactions (AEs) to mRNA vaccinations, we acknowledge that no report to VAERS establishes a causal link with the vaccination. That said, the possibility of a causal relationship is strengthened through both the causal pathways we have described in this paper, and the strong temporal association between injections and reported AEs. Nearly 60% of all mRNA-injection-related -AEs have happened within 48 h of injection.*""

This follows a line of argument used by others that the only possible explanation for higher VAERs reports close to time of injection is vaccine causation, ignoring that events immediately following injection are more likely to be considered vaccine related and thus reported.

They step through their chosen symptom categories and list what % of VAERs reports in 2021 were for COVID rather than other vaccines, supposing that high % indicates that event is “especially significant as a potential toxic effect of these vaccines”

""*We decided that a reasonable way to characterize the significance of adverse events linked to COVID-19 vaccines was to focus on events received in the year 2021, and to compare the counts in the “SYMPTOM” field for the events associated with COVID-19 vaccines to the total counts for that same symptom for all vaccines over that same year.*""

Of course, this approach assumes that event reporting rates in 2021 do not vary across vaccine type, i.e. that COVID vaccines are not more likely to be reported to VAERs than flu or other vaccines, a highly dubious assumption.

Here, from various negative control events looked up in VAERs, we can see that indeed reporting is higher for COVID than other vaccines across the board, unless you believe that vaccines cause toothaches, urinary incontinence, Xrays of limbs, or baldness.

https://preview.redd.it/n32vg6nyqgw81.jpg?width=1171&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e0989f6ad1b7f5af7fb269c48213c180ae686922

Results from several symptom categories demonstrates how their conclusions tend to overreach and ignore important confounding effects.

Here are nerve inflammation symptoms they analyzed.

https://preview.redd.it/le5sm0d0rgw81.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=839c0d48d5a2dae5efb59c7af29f9dc5ce13d46f

One nerve inflammation symptom is anosmia.  They claim this “clearly demonstrates” the spike injected into arm reached the olfactory nerve, ignoring that anosmia is common with COVID-19 but not linked to vaccine, and could be caused by previous COVID-19 infection, not vaccine.

...There were 3,657 cases of anosmia (loss of smell), clearly demonstrating that the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein from the injection in the arm was reaching the olfactory nerve...

Here are neurodegenerative disease symptoms they analyzed.

https://preview.redd.it/g6y4bi71rgw81.png?width=519&format=png&auto=webp&s=265aff5675a21285046e17466cc362943279b435

In presenting neurodegenerative diseases, they acknowledge that they take decades to develop, yet imply some sort of connection with COVID-19 vaccines rather than considering the higher numbers for COVID-19 vaccines might be from higher reporting rates for COVID-19 vaccines.

""*Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are diseases that normally take decades to develop, and ordinarily one would assume that a vaccine has nothing to do with it. While the numbers are small, most of the cases in VAERS were linked to COVID-19 vaccines.*""

They conclude by suggesting these VAERs results reflect increased cancer risk from mRNA vaccination, citing their mechanistic hypotheses, in spite of the fact that cancer takes years to form, even after exposure to fallout from a nuclear weapon like in Hiroshima.

https://preview.redd.it/fgdvpal2rgw81.png?width=505&format=png&auto=webp&s=08d77c613990d01e0738302e84cf773ae54fb7e0

""*Cancer is a disease generally understood to take months or, more commonly, years to progress from an initial malignant transformation in a cell to development of a clinically recognized condition.*""

""*However, as we have outlined in our paper, if the mRNA vaccinations are leading to widespread dysregulation of oncogene controls, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis, then VAERS reports should reflect an increase in reports of cancer, relative to the other vaccines, even if the numbers are small. The experiment demonstrating impairment of DNA repair mechanisms by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in an in vitro study provides compelling evidence that the vaccines could accelerate the rate of DNA mutations, increasing cancer risk (Jiang and Mei, 2021).*""

Their suggestions that they have evidence that mRNA vaccines increase cancer risk and that their literature review in this paper indicate mechanisms of action further demonstrate the overreaching nature of the claims made in this paper.

Scientists have detected, validated, and characterized various minority harm risks of vaccines, including anaphylaxis/myocarditis for mRNA vaccines, and VITT/GBS for viral vectors.  Detection, validation, and characterization of any other risk is critically important.

And deep characterization of the subgroups at highest risk of these serious complications, and of the severity and long-term effects of them needs to be highly prioritized research and considered in refining vaccination recommendations.

Studies like this one integrating information from existing literature to posit hypotheses explaining these harms and others can be potentially useful.

However the purported “mechanistic frameworks” laid out in this paper lack documented connections to mRNA vaccines, instead linking them to other vaccines, old mRNA technologies, or COVID-19 infections and speculating connections to mRNA vaccines.

Additionally, their case for vaccine relatedness is built upon flawed VAERs analyses that link higher reporting rates with significance as potential toxic vaccine effect, ignoring that events COVID-19 vaccination might be reported more often, as strongly suggested by the data.

Bottom line is that unless these assertions are validated, they should be acknowledged as hypotheses to investigate, not principles that should be assumed true unless disproven.  I have a feeling that is not how this paper will be represented and promoted on social media.

Studies integrating information from existing literature to posit hypotheses explaining these harms and others are potentially useful, which this paper purports to do.

However, the “mechanistic frameworks” laid out in this paper lack documented connections to mRNA vaccines, instead linking them to other vaccines, old mRNA technologies, or COVID-19 infections.  This makes their hypotheses speculative at best.

The bottom line is that this paper is comprised of a number of speculative hypothesis that can be viewed as unsubstantiated assertions.

Certainly any paper proposing hypotheses needs to acknowledge they need to be investigated and validated, not assumed true unless disproven as the conclusion of this paper seems to imply.

This is especially true when the proposed hypotheses are as weakly supported as they are in this paper.

This is not how this paper will be represented, but the ""shifting the burden of evidence"" tactic will be used to oversell the evidence for its claims and try to suggest they have demonstrated biological principles and established risks that they clearly have not."	-1

"Need studies to help convince my dad to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Hey folks! If anyone has good studies/articles that can help to show my dad there's nothing to be afraid of, feel free to share!

Backstory--> Dad has been anti-vax and pro-conspiracy since the release of the vaccine. Many of his friends don't trust the news/government, so I think they've had an effect on point of view. He's the only person in the family not to be vaccinated and because we have a relative with health conditions, they're only allowing my dad to go to Thanksgiving if he gets vaccinated. I finally got the chance to have an in-depth conversation with him today and it ended with him saying, ""Help me feel comfortable with the vaccine and maybe I'll get it"".

Main concerns of his include: possible long-term side effects, the modification of mRNA, chances of getting a stroke, and a weakened immune system that's not able to fight off a common cold.

I'd appreciate anything."	1
"Inovio vs Pfizer DD info The following is due diligence i just made for Pfizer mrna vaccine GMT antibody titers measured after two doses like Inovio. You can clearly see that with 1mg dose of Ino 4800 in the phase 2 data we have 938.8 GMT and with 2mg dose we have 2210 GMT. Now you can compare those numbers with mrna vaccine and see for yourself that even in the highest dose of Pfizer 50 micrograms Ino 4800 has 4 times more GMTs. Pfizer actually did phase 3 with 30 microgram dose and was approved with that dose and vaccinated people are getting that exact amount. So real GMT for Pfizer is 308 as seen below. That in simple math means Inovio will have 7 times more antibody titers. We have a clear WINNER. GO INOVIO. LETS BURN THOSE 50 MIL SHARES SHORT

Geometric mean titres (GMTs) of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies increased modestly in a dose-dependent manner 21 days after the priming dose (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Table 4). Substantially higher serum-neutralising GMTs were achieved 7 days after the booster dose, reaching 36 (1 ?g dose level), 158 (10 ?g dose level), 308 (30 ?g dose level), and 578 (50 ?g dose level), compared to 94 for the convalescent serum panel. On day 43 (21 days after the boost), the neutralizing GMTs and RBD-binding GMCs decreased (with the exception of the 1 ?g dose group). Serum virus-neutralizing GMTs were strongly correlated with RBD-binding IgG GMCs (Fig. 2b), and the vaccine elicited lower ratios of serum-neutralizing GMT to RBD-binding IgG GMC than did infection with SARS-CoV-2. In summary, the antibody responses elicited by BNT162b1 in study BNT162-01 largely mirrored those observed in the USA study1.

Those are the links for Inovio phase 2 preprint and Pfizer phase 1/2 data:

Do we really know why the Moderna/Pfizer vaccines can trigger such  severe symptoms like chills, fever, and insomnia? I keep hearing  rhetoric on how the side effects are better than getting infected, but  no real discussion as to why the vaccine affects certain people in such  significant ways.

(Post below was intentionally targeted and censored by Moderator:)

"" The Salk Institute released a study yesterday.

“While the findings themselves aren’t entirely a surprise, the paper  provides clear confirmation and a detailed explanation of the mechanism  through which the protein damages vascular cells for the first time.  There’s been a growing consensus that SARS-CoV-2 affects the vascular  system, but exactly how it did so was not understood. Similarly,  scientists studying other coronaviruses have long suspected that the  spike protein contributed to damaging vascular endothelial cells, but  this is the first time the process has been documented.

In the new study, the researchers created a “pseudovirus” that was  surrounded by SARS-CoV-2 classic crown of spike proteins, but did not  contain any actual virus. Exposure to this pseudovirus resulted in  damage to the lungs and arteries of an animal model—proving that the  spike protein alone was enough to cause disease. Tissue samples showed  inflammation in endothelial cells lining the pulmonary artery walls.”

Given that the vaccine injects trillions of RNA codes to create spike  proteins, then the spike proteins alone are enough to cause disease  according to the study. This may be why some people are having such  serious side effects.""

"My story as an cardiologist Hi. I just want to say that since taking the vaccine ive been suffering myself with something called premature ventricular contractions, commonly called ectopic heartbeats. Ive also got daytime fatigue, chest pains etc. Also get random moments where my heart rate goes up to 130-190. We suspect SVT, NSVT or panic attacks. My team has commited a full checkup on my health and it looks perfect. The one thing we havent checked upon is how much antibodies my body is producing. 

Personally i see more young people come in with health concernes. They all say they have taken 2-3 doses and the most common symptoms are fatigue, chest pain and heath intolerance which includes many symptoms.

I will promise you guys one thing. I will devote my career to finding out what is happening to people. I will expose the greedy millionares that are taking the lives affected for granted.

The sub is intended to help calm the anxiety that comes with a potential STD infection through education, awareness, and prevention techniques. If you have concerns about your health, please seek a health care provider to address the concerns you have. No subreddit's contents can replace actual medical care from a physician.

**INTRODUCTION**

As CDC says:

> HPV infections are so common that nearly all men and women will get at least one type of HPV at some point in their lives. Most people never know that they have been infected and may give HPV to a sex partner without knowing it. Nearly 80 million Americans are currently infected with some type of HPV. About 14 million people in the United States become newly infected each year.

> Most people with HPV never develop symptoms or health problems. Most HPV infections (9 out of 10) go away by themselves within two years. But, sometimes, HPV infections will last longer, and can cause certain cancers and other diseases. HPV infections can cause:

> * cancers of the cervix, vagina, and vulva in women;

> * cancers of the penis in men; and

> * cancers of the anus and back of the throat, including the base of the tongue and tonsils (oropharynx), in both women and men.

> * warts and genital warts

> Most HPV infections are transient and asymptomatic, causing no symptoms. More than 90% of new HPV infections, including those caused by high-risk HPV types, clear or become undetectable within 2 years, and clearance usually occurs in the first 6 months after infection.

**General rules in case of HPV infections are:**

* calm down and don't panic

* visit a doctor and consult everything with him / her

* get a proper diagnosis

* get a proper treatment

* **don't suppress your immune system** (no smoking, no drugs, avoid alcohol)

* don't experiment with your health (for example Apple Cider Vinegar ACV can cause chemical burns)

* once again: calm down, because sooner or later your HPV infection will be cleared or not detectable

* if you have lots of questions then at least check CDC's and McGill's websites

* you don't have to take any supplements to clear HPV infection. But i.e. vitamins can be useful: [Study  1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:CACO.0000003841.54413.98), [Study 2](http://cancerpreventionresearch.aacrjournals.org/content/7/11/1128.short), [Study 3](https://journals.lww.com/jewds/Fulltext/2018/09000/Serum_vitamin_D_level_in_patients_with_viral_warts.4.aspx)

"Prepandemic: I was pro vaccine, trusted the CDC, FDA, and NIH had the best interests of Americans I locked down, masked, washed hands, got vaccinated like the majority of trusting adult Americans.

But many questions were not openly answered.

What gives public health officials or the state the power to determine which businesses open and which ones are forced to shut down?
Where was the science around the six foot rule? 
What was the science around allowing some businesses / churches to operate at 25% capacity?
Is it true that the virus is many orders of magnitude smaller than the gaps in masks?
Why were outdoor activities banned?

Since these questions weren’t ever answered well by the MSM or public health officials, I had questions about the vaccines themselves which were so heavily pushed.

What is the history of the safety of MRNA technology?
Why did the definition of vaccine change?
Is the spike protein dangerous?
Are lipid nanoparticles dangerous?
How do we know that the LNP and MRNA stay localized to the injection site?
The biggie for me was: why are people who have caught covid and recovered encouraged / forced to take the vaccine? Aren’t you only exposing them to risk without any benefit?

Again, the MSM and government never gave satisfactory answers. It was always, the shots are safe and effective and if everyone does their part and gets vaccinated, we’ll reach herd immunity and the pandemic will be over.

Now as I do more research, I find that the MRNA vaccines never had a chance of stopping the pandemic; indeed, as they are non-sterilizing, they may very well prolong and worsen the pandemic to the detriment of everyone whether vaccinated or not. Furthermore, the participants in the Pfizer clinical trial were unblinded early and given the product so we can never really tell what signals of vaccine harm are since there’s no control group anymore. And for those who were indeed vaccine injured, they are mocked, gaslit, and ignored. It’s a strange way to fight this pandemic … you say that we’re in this together but when someone is hurt by the vaccine; that person is discarded. So many of the injured suffer everyday in silence. Some have died. Some have taken their own lives. It’s truly sad and tragic. I myself have had health issues since the vaccine and count myself fortunate to have rebounded somewhat from them. 

Now, even more irrationally, the vaccines continue to be pushed even though they are for the wrong strain now, are showing negative efficacy, are accumulating vaccine injured at alarming rates, and the MSM continues to go along.

At one point, I thought the MSM and government were just lazy or incompetent. Some probably are. But from this vantage point, it looks far worse than that. 

I will never trust any statement coming from the CDC, FDA, or NIH again in my life. I’ve learned my lesson; hopefully, everyone will do their own due diligence and come to their own conclusions."	-1

"Depopulation Through Vaccination is Real. And I Have the Proof: It's Through Feminization. For a while now, we've been speculating about the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on fertility. After observing recent trends, I believe there’s a deliberate effort to skew birth ratios through these vaccines. Here’s why.

Since the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, I’ve noticed a significant decline in the number of baby boys being born compared to girls. Historically, more boys than girls are born in most countries, including mine. However, this trend has started reversing since the end of 2022, which interestingly aligns with the widespread vaccination campaigns.

I started investigating this phenomenon by examining birth statistics within my own company. From 2023 to today, there have been 27 babies born: only 7 boys compared to 20 girls. This drastic imbalance raised my suspicions.

Looking at the national data in France, the pattern becomes even more apparent:

- In 2022, there were 686,564 total births, with 351,296 boys and 335,268 girls, resulting in a sex ratio of 104.8 boys per 100 girls.

- In 2023, the numbers changed to 678,002 total births, with 337,591 boys and 340,411 girls, bringing the sex ratio down to 99.2 boys per 100 girls.

This trend is not isolated to France. Similar patterns are emerging in Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Switzerland, suggesting a broader, possibly coordinated effort.

The underlying goal appears to be the destruction of the Y chromosome. Reducing the number of males in the population can have far-reaching implications for society and population growth.

You might argue that it would be more effective to target the X chromosome to reduce the number of women and therefore drastically lower reproduction rates, as one man can impregnate multiple women. However, targeting the X chromosome would be catastrophic for humanity, as both men and women carry this chromosome. Destroying the X chromosome would lead to the extinction of our species.

In contrast, targeting the Y chromosome selectively reduces the number of males while preserving the female population, thereby gradually decreasing birth rates without immediate, drastic consequences. This subtle yet significant shift could be a calculated move towards population control."	0
"Kurzgesagt video anaylsis: Not what you first thought. 
https://youtu.be/zBkVCpbNnkU

There are many things this video fails to explain and make clear:

The fact that 95% of the deaths from these diseases that vaccines prevent, are ones that occur in the poverty ridden LEDC's like yemen, parts of india, ethiopia... etc.. And most of the people that are watching the video, are from HEDC's like Canada, UK, U.S, Sweden, Norway, Japan, Australia, Germany, Italy... So the statistics they're giving are not relevant to the people who are watching the video. This makes it look as though the vaccines are saving thousands of times (YES THOUSANDS!) more lives than they actually are in most of the countries of the people who are watching the video! 

The fact that the estimates used to determine the number of lives saved, is grossly bias-ly constructed. Here's one example: CDC'S own graphs make unsubstantiated improbable conclusions. [https://imgur.com/gallery/XfoZmAn](https://imgur.com/gallery/XfoZmAn) 

The fact that there is not a single system in place to capture vaccine caused deaths and injuries, outside of the opinion of the one who makes the diagnosis. So, many vaccine injuries, and deaths, are captured under the labels of ''sudden infant death'' ''Damage to the brain'' ''unknown natural cause'' ''damage to the nervous system''.

Harvard predicts that 15,000-70,000 deaths occur each year in the USA alone, from vaccines. (Source: HHS, VAERS, NVICP)

"They’ve won. There is nothing we can do now. I’ve met so many people recently who literally don’t want to engage with any conversation about the vaccine. 

The latest was between myself and my brother. He literally said he didn’t want to have the conversation - on the basis that “millions of people were going to die” which is an argument I have heard so often now. People have been completely brainwashed by this one single “fact” and won’t even discuss anything that may change that view.

I just found out that sadly his wife’s mother fully vaccinated, has been suffering from dizziness and the doctors believe that it either has something to do with her heart or the strange blood clot that has appeared in her neck. “The doctors have never seen that before”.

No mention of the vaccine, no mention of it by the doctors. Yet here we are in a world where families are divided by knowledge about what is going on versus those in complete ignorance who literally won’t discuss anything.

For the record, I did take the vaccine as well, but it was stopped in my country after one booster. Where my brother and his family live is the UK and they really are completely brainwashed."	0
"My HPV Journey. Hi all,

I’m an 18 yo gay bottom, here to share and ask HPV related stuff.

It was August 2020 when I was diagnosed with GW on my ass. My first medication was with TCA. Initially it was more like a skin tag, but after a week, it was gone but the actual warts seem to grow. Thus, everyweek I had to visit the clinic and have TCA applied (it was a hell of an experience).

However, at some point, the cauliflower like warts seem to be gone, but there was a white spot on my ass. The nurse on the clinic said she won’t apply TCA anymore and suggested me to see a doctor instead. 

Few weeks later, I visisted a dermatologist and she immediately suggested for the wart to be removed by cauter. It was a much better experience compared to TCA, albeit still painful. A week later, I came back and though the initial wart was gone, new warts came. After 2 weeks of visiting the doctor, I stopped. This was because the hospital was closed due to covid. Thus, since September 2020, I haven’t seen a doctor to check on my ass (lol).

Good news is, I haven’t been able to see any visible warts from the outside of my ass. The bad news, the wart has come to the foreskin of my penis. However, I am more concerned with my ass. I’m concerned whether there are any internal warts.

Thus, my questions:
1. To which doctor do you see to check if there’s any internal warts?
2. Is it okay to get HPV vaccine despite already having warts?
3. Is having minor GWs a big deal, in terms of sex life?

p.s. after the last visit to the doctor, I was kinda ‘whatever’ to the whole hpv fiasco. Prolly because it was sort of gone, and my partner was (and still is) very supportive of me. Prior to the last visit, I was stressing it out so much and perhaps that leads to reoccurance of the wart."	0
Why is there SO MUCH overlap with not taking the vaccine and not wearing a mask? It's fine if you don't want the vaccine because you're scared of needles or the side effects. But why not at least wear a mask? I don't understand. If you are scared of what a vaccine can do, you know masks are still protective right?	0
"For the desperate, the lonely and the lost If you’re reading this, you’re probably feeling pretty desperate and alone. You might feel like your life has ended and now you’re completely lost with no way of finding your way back to the person you were before being diagnosed with HPV. I know this because I was - and in some ways, still am - in this exact position. It was four years ago when my ex deliberately infected me with HPV. He told me after I broke up with him, saying he had given me ‘a gift’. It was only a week or so after I left him that I developed the first wart and what he had said suddenly made sense. In the years since then I have grieved my past life and body, as well as my sex life. I have begged and pleaded with the universe to take away this curse. I have been at my most depressed. I have even wanted to kill the man who gave it to me. I have asked daily - why me? But what has happened in the past four years doesn’t matter anymore. Today I have decided to stop asking why me and instead ask what now? I have been so busy punishing and criticising myself for having the virus that I have actually made things worse for myself by increasing my stress levels and decreasing my quality of life. Today this changes. 

I’m writing this here because I have often spent hours in this forum looking for some hope and support. I want to share my journey from persistent HPV to happiness with you all so that you can find the courage to make your own journey to a better life, a life where we treat our bodies with kindness and in return our bodies can finally heal. But most of all, I want this thread to encourage us all (including me) to do one thing - forgive ourselves. It has taken me four years to be able to say this. 

Repeat after me: this is not my fault. I contracted a very common virus. I developed symptoms, and whilst that means I am aware of the virus in me, it doesn’t make me disgusting or bad. It means I am a human with a human body. Bodies get sick. This, too, is not my fault. There is no way to fully avoid HPV, and I cannot keep punishing myself for the choices I did or did not make. I deserve love and comfort and happiness. I forgive myself. 

I am making this first step of self acceptance by posting this. I have never told anyone aside from a doctor about the fact that I have HPV. But I’m tired of carrying this alone. 

I have always wished to be cured of the virus, but I haven’t done anything to support my body in this healing. So from now on: 

I am going to eat food and take supplements that give my body the best chance at fighting this virus

I am going to do exercise that makes me feel good

I am going to prioritise reducing stress

I am going to work on my self worth outside of the validation of relationships and sex

In this thread I’m going to record the next two years of my life as I finally change the pattern of living and thinking that has tied me to this virus. I’ll post food plans, supplements, routines, stress management techniques, diary entries and more to help hold me accountable and also show you that there is a way to work towards happiness despite having HPV. 

Please follow along if you think it’d help, and know that you can always find support and a positive approach in this place.

I hope reading this has felt like the warmth you need and deserve in this moment."	0
"Please spread the word Hello Ladies--If this post is not appropriate--moderators, please take it down. 

All of us, myself included, have had a diagnosis of cervical cancer.

Please, if you can, use this opportunity to vaccinate your children and, if appropriate for your circumstances, spread the word to Mom's and Dad's about the importance of this vaccine.

"Should I reach out the partner that gave me HPV 9 years ago? So one of the ways I've been reassuring myself in the unlikely event I get a recurrence of a gw is that at least future partners could get vaccinated. But then I started thinking, what if the girl who gave me HPV  had been vaccinated herself? I always assumed she hadn't for some reason, but if she had then she gave me one of the types not covered by the vaccine, and now I can't get the question out of my head.

We stopped talking to each other before I even got my first gw, so she doesn't know I ever got it from her. Hell, I don't know if she even knows she ever had it. Reaching out to her about this would be weird as hell, but on the other hand I can't get the question out of my mind.

"Please help ASC-H and HPV ALTERNATIVE REMEDIES SUGGESTIONS

My Pap smear test are atrocious I have abnormal findings in a high risk HPV and a high risk abnormal squamous cell lesion and I need to find a way to take vitamins or supplements to make this go away naturally before I have to get surgery and before the colposcopy. On top of this I also had a ovarian cyst as well as critically high chlamydia these two I’m treating separately they are the least of my issues I need some advice on what alternative therapies I can take to fight out the HPV viral disease and lesion. I need suggestions for what I can take to make myself heal to prevent having to get surgery


We have reviewed the results of your pap smear. It is a little abnormal, ASC-H and HPV positive. As you may know the pap test is a screening test for cervical cancer. Just because this result is abnormal it does not mean that you have cancer. It does mean that we need to do a diagnostic test called a colposcopy to further evaluate your cervix. This is an in office procedure done, very similar to a pap smear. There is more information at www.walkingyn.com or vaginafacts.org

Empathy for unvaccinated deaths I find it very difficult to feel sorry for people who die from covid when they were unvaccinated- granted that they were also able to get the vaccine, just chose not to. It feels like a “You made your bed, now lie in it” kinda deal. I also live in the south where there are a lot of crazy q-anon anti-pharma people. So, covid deaths aren’t uncommon. In fact, 5 people I’ve known died this week. Friends in family talk about how “terrible” it is but I just find it hard to feel bad. You made the choice to be stupid, isn’t my fault you decided to be selfish to yourself and others. I guess what I’m asking is, what do you tell yourself to feel bad for them? How do you get that sad feeling	1

this was probably ironic as i found it on r/copypasta  Hey guys anti vaxxers has a negative connotation that automatically discredits the person and writes them off as a nut. This is an interesting topic to look into. Doctors actually receive very little training on vaccines. Generally they are just given a schedule and told to follow it. There are a lot of questions surrounding the vaccine industry. They are not regulated like regular drugs. Just the fact that a bill was passed in the 90's which essentially made it impossible to sue vaccine companies should raise some eyebrows. Furthermore the government has set up a trust fund that is used to settle cases of vaccine damage. Obviously the big pharma is going to love vaccines because they are a cash cow with little regulation and zero liability. There have been a lot of studies that show a correlation between modern day diseases and vaccinations. Is this causation? That is the question. Fact is there are a lot of potentially toxic ingredients that could be more harmful than good. In the pre 80's autism was very rare like 1 on 15k. Now it's like one in 15 (stats may be a little off but you get the point). I guess the point is that this is a debate worth having. Remember those really long commercials on tv for all these great new medications, that's where stations get a lot of their funding, so just because you don't hear news stories about the possibility that vaccines may not be great is because they will not risk losing funding. I have a new son, and have been looking into the matter for that reason. It's actually pretty scary when you see the facts and statistics. Not saying don't vaccinate, but maybe some vaccines are much more dangerous than others and maybe giving your 2 month old 9 doses at a time is not a good idea. 	-1
"Within a week we'll see Omicron everywhere, massed deaths, forced vaccinations A few months ago I predicted they'd find a new variant in Africa which would be found around this time and be described as the new boogey man, but is in fact harmless. It's main role would be so they'd have an excuse to force the unvaccinated to take the vaccine.

Well here we are, the topic is of vaccine mandates is now well in the public sphere, and we've got a new scary variant from Africa that is said to be undetectable.

By my estimate in just a week or so governments will declare that Omicron was everything they feared, that it snuck past the tests and that a huge number of the population is infected. Then there will be massed deaths among vaccinated, although this will be blamed on Omicron rather than the vaccine.

And they'll use this as an excuse to mandate the vaccine for everyone, immediately. Those who refuse will be put in camps, or simply vaccinated by force.

They'll have a list of people they suspect of faking the vaccine, they'll visit them with a device that totally doesn't measure an electromagnetic field in your injection area. If the device gives a negative, you'll be told to take a booster on the spot or be classified as unvaccinated.

As more and more vaccinated die the mania will reach peak fever, unvaccinated will be tortured into compliance if need be."	-1
Just a question. Why is there so much hate for the unvaxxed when we are all getting COVID like as if nothing happened? Why are the unvaccinated being attacked when EVERYONE no matter their vax status is getting infected. Why are we getting all the hate when even 3 doses don’t protect from infection or transmission. Why is it so hard to understand that someone isn’t fully comfortable booking 3 appointments to get a vaccine they can’t even guarantee Protection from??? There’s no end point? They gave us false promises and now are adding boosters and restrictions like we werent promised that vaccines stopped infection and transmission 6 months ago? Like we weren’t told the vaccinated could stop wearing masks after 2 doses a little under a year ago? The people keep getting screwed over but the unvaccinated are blamed for EVERYONE getting sick?!?!?!?!? Why are we not blaming the government for not working twords a new cure/ better options.	-1
"Had a LEEP for CIN 3 They Found Something Else Too I want to preface this post with I am already following up with my gyno and working with a gyn/onc as well. We are hoping insurance will approve a hysterectomy so I can get rid of this problem organ once and for all. Now onto the questions and other info:

I was diagnosed with CIN 3 in November 2023. Finally got my LEEP done in March 2024 thanks to insurance dragging their feet. My gyno said I have clear margins which is great! 

But they also found something else from the biopsies they took deeper in my cervix called Lobular Endocervical Glandular Hyperplasia (LEGH). It's unrelated to HPV. The few papers I've been able to find online say it's rare and contradict each other on whether it may be directly linked to more aggressive uterine and cervical cancers. My gyno says there is no standard of care for this particular disease at this time because it's uncommon. It's so deep in there that screening isn't really possible. 

My question is, has anyone else ever had this diagnosis? I'm feeling a bit defeated. I was hoping the LEEP would be my chance to be clear of cancer and now instead they found a new possible issue. "	0
"Another Positive(ish) LEEP Story Hi All,

A few weeks ago, I was desperately scouring the internet for positive, or even neutral, experiences with LEEP. As with all things Internet, it tends to be the folks with the worst experiences who feel compelled to write about it.

I'm sharing my LEEP story for anyone else who is navigating this for the first time and feeling scared.

First, a timeline:

Late 2017/2018: First abnormal pap of my life, and also coincidentally, the first HPV test of my life. I test positive for a non-16/18 high-risk HPV. No way to know how long I've had it before then.

Colposcopy shows CIN1. The plan: watch and wait.

2019: Normal pap smear, positive HPV test. Because of the CIN last year, my gyn advises a colposcopy, just in case.

Again, the result is CIN1 and the plan is to watch and wait. My gyn thinks the normal pap is a good sign that the CIN is regressing.

2020: Normal pap smear, positive HPV test. Because of my history and the ongoing presence of HPV, I undergo my third colposcopy (by this time, I'm hardly even nervous about these.) I went in expecting CIN1 again.

Four biopsies (including ECC are taken). ECC and one of the biopsies are benign, one is CIN1, and one  is CIN3!!! Panic ensues. I am scheduled for my LEEP a month out, and spend a miserable month reading horror stories about LEEP and trying to comfort myself with data. I come to this subreddit, seeking comfort.

Before LEEP:

On the morning of my LEEP, I got a deep tissue massage, hoping it would help relax me. The massage itself was intense and painful and I told myself during it that if I can get through 90 minutes of this, a 20-minute LEEP should be no big deal. I contemplate the relationship between pain that feels voluntary vs. involuntary, recreational vs. medical. I remind myself that I've sat through tattoos that were painful, but not distressing, and that I can choose to interpret any LEEP pain in kind: a possibly painful, but not scary, choice I am making for myself.

I requested  and received a single Valium to take before the procedure. I took the Valium + 400mg ibuprofen an hour or so before my procedure.

I went into the room feeling somewhat nervous, despite reading that for most people, it doesn't hurt that much (if at all; I read many accounts saying they felt nothing!) My colposcopy biopsies were almost painless, so I took that as a hopeful sign. I remind myself of tattoos and the painful massage. The Valium is definitely helping.

During LEEP:

My partner was in the room with me for support. Like all gynecological exams, I had to undress from the waist down and get into a gown. My doctor and her assistants came in and explained the procedure and answered my questions. She tells me that they'll take out the CIN1 too, just in case, and the total amount of tissue removed will be like 2 quarters stacked together. She said that they will try to take the bare minimum to get all the CIN: she doesn't want to leave anything behind, but also doesn't want to take more than she needs. I asked her what my chances of having cancer are based on my history. She said that in 15 years of practice, she has only seen 2 cases like mine turn up a cancer result. She said the amount of tissue removed will not impact my ability to conceive/carry a pregnancy. I asked her about sexual functioning after LEEP, and she said she has never had a patient of hers experience that side effect (aside from the acute healing phase). I found that all to be reassuring.

The speculum is wider than a typical speculum because they're inserting tools and really need to see what they're doing. Mildly uncomfortable, but tolerable.

They place a grounding pad on my thigh since electricity is involved in LEEP. It's cold and sticky at first, and then I don't notice it.

Like with colposcopies, she swabbed my cervix with acetic acid aka vinegar. She then gave me 3 numbing injections into my cervix. My doctor warned me that the numbing agent causes an epinephrine response and that my heart would race. The injections felt like a pinch, and then some pressure- very tolerable. My heart began pounding and racing and my legs shook a little. Since I knew it was nothing scary, I experienced this feeling as exhilaration or excitement, like being on a roller coaster. The intense feeling made me laugh a little. It subsided in maybe 20 seconds. Fear and excitement are nearly the same, biologically speaking, and so I think this framing might help you too.

The doctor waited a minute or so for the numbing agent to kick in, then began the LEEP procedure. The machine makes a humming sound, and I feel some pressure on my cervix. She goes in 3 times, each time lasting maybe 20-30 seconds. At the end of the last biopsy, I feel a quick flash of pain; maybe a 3 or 4 out of 10. It surprised me because I wasn't expecting it, but it was over in a millisecond. I believe this is when she went deepest into my cervix to remove the CIN3. She then took an ECC which I barely felt at all. I was surprised at how fast the LEEP was.

She then had to cauterize the tissue to prevent bleeding. The cauterization machine sounds a bit like a dental drill, which I found unsettling. In hindsight, headphones would've been a good idea. The cauterization itself was mildly painful for me; maybe a 2/3 out of 10, and feels like a superficial pain, rather than cramping. I think the sound had something to do why I disliked this part. I squeezed my partner's hand, and it was tolerable and over in about 1-2 minutes. She swabbed on the iodine and Monsel solution to seal up the wound some more.

After the LEEP:

I had some mild cramping and very little discharge on Day 1. I took it easy and watched movies and ate vegan pizza and carrot cake :) I highly advise treating yourself after. I wore a huge pad and expected a lot of blood, but nope!

The next day, I felt normal. I went apple-picking! No cramping, no bleeding, but a clear/pinkish discharge began. It was a small amount, easily controlled with a panty liner.

On day 3 post-LEEP, the liquid bandage came off. This is \*NOT SKIN\* or tissue, though it looks a lot like it. I've seen many posts of people thinking this is dead skin or a miscarriage- nope, it's a liquid bandage, and when it comes out, it usually means you're healing. Yay! I also began getting the predictable coffee ground discharge. Still no bleeding.

Now just over a week out, the only thing I continue to notice is a clear/pinkish discharge, at times flecked with scab tissue. It smells very metallic, sort of like fresh blood, but isn't blood. It doesn't smell bad or gross- just like metal. I change my pantyliners a few times a day. Very manageable.

A week to the day after my LEEP, I got my results: CIN 2/3, and clear margins! My ECC was benign. That means no cancer was found, and the ""clear margins"" aka ""negative margins"" means that there were no bad cells on the edge of the sample. Bad cells surrounded by healthy tissue means they got all the bad cells, which means the likelihood of recurrence/future procedures is lower. For folks with positive margins/bad cells all the way up to the end, their chance of clearing the remaining cells is still quite high, but the possibility of needing another LEEP is somewhat greater, I believe.

With my doctor's approval, a week after I also began low impact indoor cycling and light exercise using my own body weight (push-ups, planks, etc.) So far, so good! She also said that after a week, external sexual stimulation is okay; just no penetration, and make sure your hands/toys are clean.

What's Next:

I follow up 6 weeks post-LEEP to make sure my cervix healed normally. If all looks good, then. I can resume penetrative sex, swimming, etc.

In 6 months, I will get another pap and HPV test and hopefully (likely) will be clear of both bad cells and the HPV. In most cases, people clear the virus quickly after LEEP.

I hope this long account provides some comfort to someone who was in my shoes. The long and short of it is that no, it's not a fun procedure. BUT, it's nowhere NEAR as bad as you fear. It is tolerable. I promise that as a human on this Earth, you have experienced worse discomfort in your day-to-day life.

You can control how you decide to think about and frame this experience for yourself. You can choose to interpret any pain as horrible, or the machine sounds as terrifying, or focus on that lost chunk of tissue. For some, I'm sure this experience is genuinely traumatic; from everything I've read, those cases are rare, and going into a medical procedure assuming it will be traumatic for YOU is not doing you any favors.

Or, you can instead go into it with a narrative that you've tolerated way worse pain/discomfort in other contexts, that these bad cells are finally coming out, that a small piece of lost cervix is relatively inconsequential compared to what can be lost to cancer, and that you'll soon be able to put this stress behind you. No more watching and waiting and anxious anticipation!

I found that opening up to friends, family, and this community have been an immense source of comfort and support. There is no need for shame, regret, blame, or the ""should haves."" They don't change anything, and they certainly don't help you now.

Best of luck to anyone going through this process. One way or another, you will be okay.


UPDATE: 6 months later and I just got my pap and HPV test results. Both are NEGATIVE!!! LEEPs work, y’all. I couldn’t be more relieved :) I hope this helps with some of your fear."	0
"Why do so many provaxxers keep perpetuating the myth that ""vaccines are not profitable""? I've heard this said many times, almost like vaccines are a public service and pharmaceutical companies make very little money on them.

Well, to give an example of just 1 pharmaceutical company, GSK :

* In 2018, GSK made an operating profit of £5,744 million from pharmaceutical drugs, of which they have dozens and dozens of different types
* By comparison, vaccines operating profit was £1,943 million, but they only sell a handful of different vaccines so this is quite favourable really. Especially when you can convince governments around the world to buy one for every citizen!

"Can I change my parents minds? Or do I just nod along? My stepmother (in her 60s) is INCREDIBLY anti-vax. She even believes that animals should never be vaccinated. She’s turned my dad against vaccines too. They get the flu EVERY SINGLE YEAR because they refuse to get a flu shot. They’ve gotten Covid too a few times. 

Stepmom claims to have read hundreds of books containing science against vaccination. I don’t even have children yet but she already is pushing me against vaccinating my future children (which will never work, they’re getting vaccinated 100%). 

Do I nod along and try not to anger her? Is that the best route? During the summer I spend a lot of time at my parents house and I want it to be a civil environment.

"Can I have a second opinion on something? My coworker claims to not be antivax, and she technically isn’t. Though, she says that she only got COVID shots because she needed to work and she never would have otherwise. She thinks that the cure for cancer has already been found and that it’s being held back because chemotherapy makes more money, and applies the same logic to most vaccines.
Essentially, she tells me the medical industry is corrupt, that pharmacies and vaccines are mostly just for getting as much money as possible.

Keep in mind we are in Canada and got our COVID shots for free, though I do realize that does not apply to all medications and vaccinations by a long shot.

Idk I’m just really confused if what she says holds any water, and I’d love to hear some outside input. To me it seems teetering in the edge of conspiracy."	-1
"Possible Cancer but HPV negative? Hi, im 25 years old and I had my first abnormal pap in 2020-2021 but was HPV negative so I was told to come back in a year, so fast forward to a year and half later... I had another pap (pregnant at time with my 5th child) it was also abnormal, the doctor wanted to send me for a colpscopy but he changed his mind and said that since I'm only 25 and also pregnant that we would wait until I had the baby and repeat the pap because giving birth etc can wash all the ""bad"" cells away ......  I put it off due to owing the doctor money and didnt do a repeat pap right after I gave birth (stupid me) ...so here we are ..... 5 months after having my baby ... I felt a bump on my cervix and very rough texture I started having bleeding in between my period and having cramps, the blood is light pink and has a milky watery look to it and I've also passed some tissue looking stuff and I'm having very frequent urination and watery discharge (none of this has any odor or anything)   ... so I scheduled a pap with a new doctor (I've seen her before but it's been years) while she was doing my pap I was bleeding a good bit and she found a knot on my cervix and also said it was red and swollen with tissue looking stuff..... she said it could possibly be a cyst that I would need a ultrasound to confirm that .... but she said we would wait on my Pap results and go from there .. so that's where I'm at .... worried to death waiting on pap results that I just know are not going to be good news. Every time I google anything I only find story's of HPV positive cancer but I do not have HPV.. never had a std or anything out of the normal in my life ... so I'm so confused as to how I would have even developed cervical cancer? I know its possible but so rare. I also thought it took years to develop.... I've had 5 kids from 2014 to 2022 so surely they would have found something all those years .... or did it take all the way until 2021 to show on a pap that I was experiencing cell changes? Even then... how would it have delvoped so fast in 3 years that im experiencing symptoms etc? I'm so lost :("	0
I am so... fucking goddamned done I’m sorry for the language and I hope this doesn’t get taken down cause of it. 10 months ago I got cheated on by someone I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with. I left her. Well now I’m starting to experience symptoms of  hpv. I got them growing on my cock, I got them probably growing on my ass and I got them probably in my urethra. I feel like my life ahead is going to be a living hell. I want to go kill the fuckin asshole that did this to me. I’m sorry for being so vague but goddamnit I hate my life.

"Why vaccines are healthy and safe. *What is mRNA vaccines?

An mRNA vaccine is a type of vaccine that uses a copy of a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) to produce an immune response. The vaccine delivers molecules of antigen-encoding mRNA into immune cells, which use the designed mRNA as a blueprint to build foreign protein that would normally be produced by a pathogen (such as a virus) or by a cancer cell. These protein molecules stimulate an adaptive immune response that teaches the body to identify and destroy the corresponding pathogen or cancer cells. The mRNA is delivered by a co-formulation of the RNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles that protect the RNA strands and help their absorption into the cells.

Reactogenicity, the tendency of a vaccine to produce adverse reactions, is similar to that of conventional non-RNA vaccines. People susceptible to an autoimmune response may have an adverse reaction to messenger RNA vaccines. The advantages of mRNA vaccines over traditional vaccines are ease of design, speed and lower cost of production, the induction of both cellular and humoral immunity, and lack of interaction with the genomic DNA.[5][6] While some messenger RNA vaccines, such as the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, have the disadvantage of requiring ultracold storage before distribution, other mRNA vaccines, such as the Moderna, CureVac, and Walvax COVID-19 vaccines, do not have such requirements.

*How is mRNA vaccines different from traditional vaccines?

Vaccines work by training our bodies to recognize invading viruses. Traditional vaccines perform this task by introducing a dead, inactive, or modified portion of a virus into our body so that our immune system can learn to recognize and fight this foreign invader.

In the case of Moderna’s and Pfizer-BioNTech's mRNA vaccines, we are not injected with a whole virus or even a piece. Instead, we are supplied mRNA that instructs our cells to make a version of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These instructions teach our cells to become their own vaccine manufacturing plants.

In the lab, scientists create synthetic mRNA containing the spike protein sequence. This encoded information is delivered through the jab, and it instructs some of our cells to manufacture spike proteins. The spike proteins trigger our immune cells to assemble antibodies capable of recognizing them. If the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the virus behind COVID-19, infects a vaccinated person, then the trained antibodies sound an alarm, leading to an immune response to fend off the infection.

The fundamental idea behind using a vaccine to teach a body’s immune system dates back over 200 years, but the use of mRNA is a recent development. Compared to other methods, mRNA leads the way in both speed and flexibility.

*Why is mRNA vaccines preferred?

In theory, the underlying technology behind mRNA vaccines is adaptable, allowing for quick updates as new viral mutations (variants) evolve or whole new viruses are discovered. Since mRNA vaccines are based on sequences of viral proteins, making a new vaccine could simply involve changing the mRNA sequence if you know what protein you want to make.

mRNA vaccines are also quicker and more reliably manufactured than traditional vaccines. For Moderna, the entire process—from vaccine design to manufacturing to shipment—took only 7 weeks. Although design and production of mRNA vaccines may take only weeks, necessary clinical trials to evaluate safety and efficacy still require several months of testing.

In contrast, other forms of vaccines use disabled or weakened viruses (i.e. measles and hepatitis A). These can take months or years to design. Manufacturing enough viruses to vaccinate a large portion of society can be a cumbersome process. For example, the influenza virus is grown inside fertilized chicken eggs, which are obtained from sterile laying facilities.

*Which is better? Letting people get natural immunity or vaccinating them?

The average mortality rate of covid 19 is 3% and it may not sound much, but there are 7.9 billion people on earth.

So if 3 per 100 people died due to covid. Then the death toll would be 237000000 people. And it would be much higher as the health care system would collapse due to overload leading lack of care and unsanitary conditions.

The adverse effects related to covid vaccine (this data might be inaccurate since it might not be vaccine related)

Anaphylaxis after COVID-19 vaccination is rare and has occurred in approximately 5 people per one million vaccinated.

Reports of death after COVID-19 vaccination are rare. FDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it’s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem. More than 520 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from December 14, 2020, through January 10, 2022. During this time, VAERS received 11,225 reports of death (0.0022%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. CDC and FDA clinicians review reports of death to VAERS including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records.

There are few other vaccine related adverse effects but it is yet to be understood if its true and the scale is minuscule.

*How does covid 19 mRNA vaccines work? (And few other types of vaccines)

A coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine can prevent you from getting COVID-19 or from becoming seriously ill or dying due to COVID-19. But how do the different types of COVID-19 vaccines work?

Each COVID-19 vaccine causes the immune system to create antibodies to fight COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccines use a harmless version of a spikelike structure on the surface of the COVID-19 virus called an S protein.


The main types of COVID-19 vaccines currently available in the U.S. or being studied include:

Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine. This type of vaccine uses genetically engineered mRNA to give your cells instructions for how to make the S protein found on the surface of the COVID-19 virus. After vaccination, your muscle cells begin making the S protein pieces and displaying them on cell surfaces. This causes your body to create antibodies. If you later become infected with the COVID-19 virus, these antibodies will fight the virus.

After delivering instructions, the mRNA is immediately broken down. It never enters the nucleus of your cells, where your DNA is kept. Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines use mRNA.

Vector vaccine. In this type of vaccine, genetic material from the COVID-19 virus is placed in a modified version of a different virus (viral vector). When the viral vector gets into your cells, it delivers genetic material from the COVID-19 virus that gives your cells instructions to make copies of the S protein. Once your cells display the S proteins on their surfaces, your immune system responds by creating antibodies and defensive white blood cells. If you later become infected with the COVID-19 virus, the antibodies will fight the virus.

Viral vector vaccines can't cause you to become infected with the COVID-19 virus or the viral vector virus. Also, the genetic material that's delivered doesn't become part of your DNA. The Janssen/Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is a vector vaccine. AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford also have a vector COVID-19 vaccine.

Protein subunit vaccine. Subunit vaccines include only the parts of a virus that best stimulate your immune system. This type of COVID-19 vaccine contains harmless S proteins. Once your immune system recognizes the S proteins, it creates antibodies and defensive white blood cells. If you later become infected with the COVID-19 virus, the antibodies will fight the virus.

Novavax is working on a protein subunit COVID-19 vaccine.

"Had my first colposcopy today 35f, just diagnosed with High risk HPV, not sure what strain, with HSIL. 

Never had kids, but would like them in the future.

I had my first colposcopy today.

Had tissue taken from cervicql canal, and 4 biopsies on the cervix (2 near 12 o clock, and 2 near 6 o clock.)

The procedure itself took over 30 minutes, ugh. And it was more uncomfortable then expected. 
I took 400mg Ibuprofen and .5 lorazepam 45 min before, but it provided little to no relief.. Ouch.

Will post my results.

FYI...
I started a supplement called AHCC That is Currently in clinical trials to eradicate HPV virus. I’ll keep everyone updated and wish everyone the absolute best!"	0
"Not vaccinating your kid DOES hurts other kids. I just wanted to try and address something I have been seeing around the internet lately.
Disclaimer: I am not a doctor or a licensed professional, I am I teenager. (Also sorry for any formatting mistakes, I’m writing this on mobile)

Many anti-vax parents have been spreading information that claims that if “pro vaxxers are vaccinated, why are they afraid anti vaxxers will get them sick?” 

This is a very stupid thing for someone to say. ..I, a pro vaxxer, am not fully vaccinated. When I was younger I experienced a rare allergic reaction to a specific ingredient in a vaccine. No I did not get autism from the vaccine, I just became ill. 

What this means is because I don’t have all my vaccines... your stupidity and unwillingness to follow any sort of common sense could kill me.

Now you may be thinking... ALLERGIC REACTION? I don’t want my baby to die from an ALLERGIC REACTIONS! Don’t worry, what happened to me was fairly uncommon. Your baby will surely die of polio before an allergic reaction does. "	1
"Vaccined but testing positive *Not my personal experience*

House of fully vaccinated people contracted covid from their child (too young to be vaccinated).  My understanding is Moderna and Pfizer are around 95% effective in preventing people from contracting covid.  In this household, 3 fully vaccinated people contracted covid from their child.  So in this case the vaccine was not at all effective in preventing covid.  Based on the statistics wouldn't it make sense that some people in the household would not contract covid?"	-1

"Thick white discharge, no yeast infection. Cervical cancer?? I’m 20 and have never gotten a pap smear because they do not give it to you if you are under 21. I currently am being treated for vulvodynia and vaginismus, and I also have yet to follow up on a LH FSH hormone level of 2:1 (which could be indicative of PCOS, though I do not have any other symptoms). I also do not have the Gardasil vaccine as my parents refused when I was younger, and I simply have not gotten around to scheduling it since I turned 18. I also experience vaginal dryness, which I suspect could be due to undiagnosed autoimmune issues.

Pretty much all throughout my cycle, I have had very thick, white discharge that smells and tastes very sour. I know that this is normal in certain parts of the cycle, but for me it is pretty much 100% of the time. I also do not know when it started as this has just kind of been my ”normal” for awhile. I knew this wasn’t totally normal, but I never thought it was a big enough deal to ask about it or even look it up. Upon looking it up, I am seeing from old Reddit posts that this could be a sign of cervical cancer???

the thing about vaccines is that the science is correct but there isn't any competition to big pharma so there isn't anything stopping them from making shit quality vaccines. ""Federal law grants drug companies immunity from certain lawsuits from injuries or deaths tied to vaccines, the US Supreme Court affirmed."" so no one can sue them as well. isn't this dangerous?? personally i think that vaccines are good but big pharma has too much power, no competition, and no need to advertise (because it is mandatory to vaccinate for schools, or to be in certain communities in some cases). also, anti vaxxers are shunned by the majority causing them to stick together like a horde of sheep. and while i don't agree with most of the shit they make up, i do believe that big pharma is waaay to powerful for their own good and needs to be debuffed. please reply if you have time."	0

See figures 1 and 2. Article is pre-print, but data is quite unexpected. Obviously there are a lot of variables that are not controlled for here, and there is no data discussing severity of illness. Perhaps natural infection provides better protection than vaccination, which makes sense based on other viruses. It is clear that time from last infection informs the risk of contracting a new infection. It is possible that the population in the highly vaccinated group has higher risk factors, but the trend is striking. Could there be more at play than just behavior or risk factors, perhaps some sort of immune ignorance?"	0
"Why do so many provaxxers keep perpetuating the myth that ""vaccines are not profitable""? I've heard this said many times, almost like vaccines are a public service and pharmaceutical companies make very little money on them.

Well, to give an example of just 1 pharmaceutical company, GSK :

* In 2018, GSK made an operating profit of £5,744 million from pharmaceutical drugs, of which they have dozens and dozens of different types
* By comparison, vaccines operating profit was £1,943 million, but they only sell a handful of different vaccines so this is quite favourable really. Especially when you can convince governments around the world to buy one for every citizen!

"The Great Vaccine Deception: The Vaccine is Called a Covid-19 Vaccine. Covid-19 is NOT the virus. The Virus is SARS-CoV-2 If it was a true vaccine it would be called a SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine but as Fauci already said, these vaccines will NOT create an immunity to the Virus. They will just suppress the respiratory symptoms that are known as Covid-19.

This means they are not vaccines they are theraputics.

So the insideous motive should be clear. While big pharma shoots up the masses with their psuedo vaccine that suppresses the initial respiratory symptoms that have been so bothersome and embarrassing to the government, the virus itself will continue circulating and repeatedly infecting everyone, inflicting cummulative damage that eats away at our heart, Liver, Kidneys and brain until we all started dying of multiple organ failure.

There have already been several small studies that show the virus causes long term heart damage and last Saturday we saw Florida Gators star, Keyontae Johnson in critical condition after collapsing during the Gators v Florida State game with suspected post-covid myocarditis.

*'Like most of his teammates, Johnson tested positive for COVID-19 during the summer. Although the cause of Johnson's ailment was not immediately known, the coronavirus can lead to myocarditis, a viral infection of the heart muscle.'*

The fact the ESPN article links this incident to the coronavirus and myocarditis so soon after his collapse shows the mainstream media already knows what to expect."	0
"20 Questions for vaccine proponents  

1. If we don't know what causes autism how do we know that vaccines don't cause it?
2. How did we determine that vaccines don't cause autism?
3. How many unvaccinated children did they look at to determine that vaccines are safe?
4. How many orphans were used to make sure vaccines are safe? Did they use a large enough number?
5. Why do scientists expect to find health differences in groups of children that receive an equal number of vaccines?
6. If  vaccines are so safe why do people feel it was unethical to test them  on mentally handicapped individuals? Didn't they benefit from the shots?
7. How does one fraudulent doctor make all vaccines safe?
8. Does that mean we should have more fraudulent doctors so that vaccines can be even safer?
9. They  teach medical students ""Half of everything we teach you is wrong"" and  then ""We know that vaccines are very safe"". Does that mean there is a  50% chance that vaccines are less safe than previously thought?
10. Why is everything the WHO and the CDC say true?
11. Are there statistics not sponsored by the CDC that show 100% of what the WHO says is correct?
12. Why is the absence of the smallpox virus evidence of influenza vaccine safety?
13. What percentage of neonates share needles?
14. Why did studies find vaccination is associated with decreased autism risk?
15. Does that mean vaccines protect against autism?
16. Does that mean we aren't vaccinating enough if there are still many children with autism?
17. Why  is a non-randomized study that finds vaccine cause harm not evidence of  non-safety because it's not randomized but and non-randomized study  that shows vaccines to be safe is evidence of safety?
18. What language does the immune system use and what language do adjuvants speak? Do adjuvants ever stop talking?
19. Does  the immune system understand that it should produce antibodies against  the antigen but not the other ingredients in the vaccine?
20. What is the biological mechanism by which vaccines caused the government to pay out billions to victims of vaccine injury?

"Anti-van and Epi pens (Sorry abt the title, auto correct got weird)

Hi ho. Just had a little thought. I saw a post a whole ago about a mother who thought that allergies only happened because of vaccines (obviously untrue). She gave her daughter a pb&j, which the daughter had an allergic reaction to.

I had a scary thought, did the mother think to use an epi pen? Do anti-vax people think epi pens are just as bad as vaccines?!

I don’t know, but if anyone reads this, your kids need vaccines, people having allergic reactions need epi pens or they WILL (lots of emphasis on the WILL) DIE, and they don’t need essential oils or whatever other dumpster trash you think is “good for themselves”"	1
"Is it Possible That Pfizer Did This to Me? Hello, I’m a 22M, no health issues before, only drink about one beer a week. On August 16 I took the first dose of the Pizer vaccine, after 5 days I wrote on my journal that I was having weird intestinal problems, such as pain, diarrhea, back pain, pale stool, and pain around my ribcage. I didn’t make the link because I thought it could be something else. I went to the ER and the doctor said that it could be a viral gastroenteritis. I took the medications prescribed by the doctor and assumed everything would be alright after a few days. The problems didn’t go away, in fact, one day it got really bad and I made an appointment with a gastroenterologist(in my country you can make appointments with any specialized doctor by yourself). When I got there, I described what I had, and she made me do some exams, a detailed blood test, and a ultrasonography of my abdomen. The results of the blood test arrived today, and it's the one below, the one above is a blood test that I did on June because I was planning on doing a surgery to remove gynecomastia, but I gave up. A symptom that I described that have a link with these results is that when I have “flare ups”, the stool looks like its pale or losing its color. The results of the ultrasonography didn’t arrive yet, but the doctor who performed it said that he saw nothing wrong, and I was ok. I was thinking if the vaccine could have screwed up my liver, pancreas, or my spleen. I know that this alteration on my bilirubin is not that significative, but it’s very noticeable.

Since I can't post the image, I'll say the result.

June:  Direct Bilirubin- 0.16mg/dL // Indirect Bilirubin- 0.25mg/dL // Total Bilirubin- 0.41mg/dL

October: Direct Bilirubin- 0.24mg/dL // Indirect Bilirubin- 0.48mg/dL // Total Bilirubin- 0.72mg/dL

I have to say, I’m not an antivaxer, in fact, I really was very comfortable with taking the vaccine, that's why I only started to make the link after a few weeks of symptoms."	1

If you got into a car accident and survived, would you not wear your seatbelt after?  Just because you had COVID, which I’m sure does give you some immunity for some period of time, doesn’t mean there’s ANY reason not to get a simple shot that is now approved by the FDA and everyone else.  

You know every person who works at Fox News is vaccinated?  You know most of the stuff you post on FB gets flagged as infactual?  It’s not some huge conspiracy. It’s taking lives. And now it’s taking babies lives.   

How do you think Polio was eradicated ? AIDS? Any other major disease? Literally our DOGS have to have vaccines to go to the vet. Lily has already had, what, 15 shots? And she will be getting the COVID vaccine the second it’s available so we don’t have to be fearful every single day. Since when were vaccines the enemy!? Even Trump is vaccinated!   

I know you have lived through some difficult times yourself. But you can’t imagine what’s it’s like to you that us parents are protected but our vulnerable, precious little girl is not! I would so much rather it be the other way around! So, yes, for the sake of her and all other innocent, unprotected children, get the safe, approved, not-hoax vaccine. Just get it!   

Stop believing the sources that come across your FB! They are absolutely insane! The internet is full of con artists and fake websites and fake stories all to get clicks and sell ads. And you can’t keep falling for all of it. But wait - who do you think the bad guys are … CNN?

Similar experience? 25 diagnosed with stage 1 This whole experience has been an emotional roller coaster and now that’s I’ve processed what I needed to, I feel like I tuned out some information and I’m not sure where I stand with my diagnosis. I’m 25, had a Pap smear that showed HPV positive/abnormal cells. Followed up with a biopsy and was diagnosed with stage 1 cervical cancer but was told the affected area could be surgically removed as I want children one day and because it was caught early, I would not need chemo and radiation. After the surgery and at my follow up, I was told the they were able to remove the affected area, margins were clear, and I did not have to come back for 6 months. I take full accountability for not asking questions but I went through this process alone (did not tell family or friends) so between the immense anxiety that was immediately relieved after hearing they removed the cancer, I thanked them and went on my merry way. It’s been a week since that last appointment and I’m aware that it could come back but is this remission or NED? I’ve been looking at other posts to see if anyone had a similar experience but haven’t found anything.

"mRNA Hesitant - Help! UPDATE 2: I did not receive the J&J - instead, I received the Novavax vaccine which I have been waiting nearly a year for. I will have to deal with some personal and career related repercussions as a result, but I will be able to sleep easy knowing my concerns and the outstanding questions I have aren’t relevant to this type of vaccine. Best of luck to all.

UPDATE: u/827753 was able to alleviate my concerns through rational respectful discussion. Risks of negative effects due to spike proteins entering the nucleus is likely irrelevant, as the immune system destroys the factory cells. The follow up concern of the vaccine entering brain cells and leading to destruction of those brain cells is minimized by the difficulty of both the LNPs and adenovirus passing through the blood brain barrier, and their viability after passing through the heart. They acknowledged that there are uncertainties and non zero possibilities of negative effects, but reduced those risks to negligible through evidence and logic. 

I have booked my J&J shot for Thursday.

To those who simply dismissed my concerns using ad hominem attacks, red herrings, and non-sequiturs - you will never help anyone with a bad attitude like that. People who are unvaccinated against COVID19 are not all irrational, unintelligent people, or even anti-vaccination.

Arriving at the right conclusion through faulty logic and/or blind trust doesn’t make you intelligent - it makes you lucky. 

*********************************************
Let me please preface this by saying I am not anti-vaccination. I studied micro-biology and biochemistry for 2.5 years before transitioning to engineering, so while I’m by no means an expert in the field, I understand the basic science and know vaccines are effective. 

I have a concern, that quite frankly, nobody has been able to quell and I’m hoping there are some much more knowledgeable people on the matter that could put my mind at ease.

I am a skeptic by nature and while I know the people working on these mRNA vaccines are brilliant, I also know they are human. I also understand the scope of the problem and know that people had to work quickly to implement a solution to a novel virus. There exists room for unintended consequences.

My preference has been to delay taking the mRNA vaccines and holding out until Novavax is available in my location, as my concerns do not hold true with Novavax. However, due to personal and job related reasons, it would be extremely beneficial for me to take the J&J vaccine this week. Novavax is supposed to be available on Tuesday, but I will not be fully vaccinated in time taking Novavax.

My primary concern at the moment is the findings of this study:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8538446/

Essentially, full length spike protein was found to inhibit DNA repair mechanism in-vitro. The primary concern is negative impact on the immune system, but also, the inherent elevated risk of cancer in mucking with these mechanisms.

I understand this is in-vitro. I understand that the spike protein coded for in the mRNA based vaccines is a modified version. But it is still the full length spike protein - it’s simply been modified to have a trans membrane domain added to keep it from exiting the cell completely and wandering through the human body (correct me if I’m wrong).

So, the reality is, normal full length spike protein enters the cell nucleus and inhibits DNA repair mechanisms in-vitro. This has not been confirmed yet by any published work in-vivo, but given the in-vitro results, an in-vivo study would be warranted. While the spike protein in the vaccines is modified from the original, they are both identical in that they contain the full length spike. It’s quite possible that the expressed modified spike proteins are similar enough to affect these mechanisms as well. It certainly warrants further study.

Like I said, the people who developed these mRNA vaccines are brilliant, but there’s still lots we don’t know and we are learning. If these modified spike proteins did enter the nucleus and affect DNA repair, that would concerning. Or have we studied this? Can someone find evidence that this is not a concern?

Like I said, I would like to overcome this hesitancy for a number of reasons. But unless I’m sure, I can’t justify injecting myself with a potentially carcinogenic (if the results of this study are reproduced in-vivo with the modified spike) immune dis regulating vaccine when an option that I have no concerns about is right around the corner.

So, if someone could put my mind at ease and convince me to get the J&J this week, it would save me a lot of trouble."	1
Why do anti-vaxxers hate autism? I know plenty of people with autism, and yet I cannot even tell they have it usually.

"Why did vaccines lower my body core temperature? Hello, I had my usual covid and flu vaccine yesterday. I'm pro vaccine.

"Refusing a vaccine that doesn't vaccinate is not being anti-vaxx, it's being intelligent... Calling these shots vaccines was a brilliant move because most of the population has a positive view of vaccines.  Pretty much everyone gets innoculated against measels, mumps, rubella, polio and other diseases....and you never ever heard of hundreds of infections in a single day from those diseases.  A vaccine by defintion is something which produces antibodies which produces immunity....and immunity is immunity, you don't get the disease....not a mild case, not medium, not severe, you're immune.

That's why vaccines are alternately referred to as immunizations....an immunization immunizes.  My vaccination booklet actually says ""Immunization Record"", and in there I've got them all, MMR, Polio, Malaria, dTap etc.....but how could you put Covid in there?  The immunization that doesn't immunize?  That would be like calling my Dodge Caravan an airplane.

I'm a Christian, and while I can't claim to be 100% perfect in never bearing false witness I do try....so I didn't want to say:  ""I'm vaccinated"" when someone asks about the Covid shots.  But now I don't have any compunction about it at all.  The covid part is inferred of course, people just ask if you're vaccinated, or if you're fully vaccinated....from now on I'm going to say yes.  If they ask if that includes the covid vaccines I can say yes, because there is no covid vaccine yet.

Just rambling, but this world has gone crazy.  Someone not wanting to get on a boat that doesn't float wouldn't be called an anti-boater.  Why should someone refusing a vaccine that doesn't vaccinate be called anti-vaxx?  I live in Ontario and in just the past two days over 1,500 people said to be fully vaccinated are infected with the very virus they were supposed to have been vaccinated against."	1

Truly curious, why is everyone so surprised about the vaccine side effects, if every medication in history has always had a group of people with side effects? Also, why would the governments want to kill or control us to become “one” if majority make them money and they wouldn’t want to risk the “wealthy” ones dying off/becoming ill?	-1

"Beauty influencer dies at 36 after publicly sharing her battle with cervical cancer. After reading the article, what are your thoughts. After reading the article I do have to say that I am sadden by this. This story hits home for not only me but everyone on this forum.


I feel like the doctors failed her and once it was too late she opted out of treatment after finding out she has stage 3 cervical cancer. Do you think she had a chance of living?

My personal experience was when found out I was HPV positive last March and I had surgery for CIN 2 back in November of 2023. Luckily I had clear margins but my heart aches for what she had to go through. 

Not trying to fear monger but just wanted to have this discussion.

"dad is starting to question vaccines (I and all his children are vaccinated) alright Reddit I have a dilemma, as my title states my dad is starting to question the logic behind vaccines and im not sure how to explain why he is wrong so i require you alls assistance 

So the problem started a few weeks ago, i was talking to him about the stuff i see online (theres not much else to talk about as i am 15 and he is almost in his late 50s), and then he started talking about him recieving only like 3 vaccines when he was little ruhbella and 2 others (forgot the names of the others) and he questioned how many vaccines that kids get now a days.
He was also confused as to the logic of how people got measles when they were vaccinated (but i may have explained it badly). Hes a logical guy i just think hes getting misdirected and i want to help him before he is fully 'corrupted'

Thx in advance

Edit: He did some research on his own and from what I understand he is good now, thanks anyway tho (I think he did this bc were going to Coasta Rica in the Summer and it's HIGHLY recommended that you get vaccines to ensure you don't get messed up in the more rural parts/small towns)!"	1

"California Senate Bill 276 Pro vaccine father here. California removed personal and religious exemption beliefs with SB 277 in 2015. Now, California is proposing another bill, SB 276, that will disqualify medical exemptions for all non-life threatening vaccine reactions. For example, if a child has seizures or temporary paralysis after receiving an injection, then that child will be forced to continue with their immunization schedule if they want to attend school. 

The politicians behind this bill say it’s all about going after doctors that hand out fake medical exemptions. That’s fine, I’m all for that. What I am torn about is that this same bill drastically narrows the scope of what side effects qualify for a medical exemption. Basically, children would need to have born with an autoimmune disease or prove they suffered permanent damage from a vaccine in order to receive a medical exemption from the State.  

How do you guys feel about this law?"	1
"Here's my experience with a genital wart to hopefully help others I (34M gay) am writing this post in hopes it’ll help someone struggling with HPV and genital warts like I did.  I wanted to share my experience with genital warts to assure others it’s not a big deal. HPV is super common and warts are something doctors see all the time so please don’t feel ashamed to get medical attention instead of trying to treat them yourself at home. 

Back in 2021 I first noticed a small growth at the base of my shaft and knew it was a genital wart even though I was really hoping it was just something like a skin tag.  I was so ashamed and embarrassed that I didn’t want to talk to a doctor or anyone else about it and I decided to treat it  it myself. I used cuticle clippers and a lot of rubbing alcohol to make sure everything was very clean.  I numbed myself with an ice cube and then simply cut it off (again, it was a really small growth).  WOW - it bled like crazy and was sore for about a week while it healed, but it did get rid of the wart….. at least for a year. Please don't do this - it was dumb and didn't fix the problem; just go see a doctor.

In November of 2022, after about a year the wart started growing again. This time I was just tired of worrying about it an the shame associated with it so decided to finally see a doctor. At first I was freaking out about making an appointment because of the shame and stigma of STI’s. I always hate getting tested because of the awkward questions around your sexual activities and I feel like they judge you and your answers. Regardless, YOU SHOULD GET TESTED REGULARLY IF YOU’RE SEXUALLY ACTIVE.  It’s so important to get tested even if you don’t have symptoms.   

I skipped going to a clinic or my regular doctor because I was already sure it was a genital wart - I didn’t need a diagnosis, I needed it removed.  The dermatologist was able to get me into the office quickly but I was still so nervous about discussing my warts with someone else and the embarrassment of standing there with my dick out for them to examine.  When I got to the dermatologist office, I told the nurse I had a wart (maybe two) in my groin area.  When the dermatologist came in, she told me to drop my drawers so she could take a look. Since my warts were only at the base of my shaft I was able to keep most of my dick covered and just pull down my underwear to show the top part of my dick.  It was still a little embarrassing, but really not that bad.

The doctor took one look and said “yeah, that’s a genital wart”. Then she used liquid nitrogen to freeze both off (cryotherapy)- it took about 30 seconds and while it was not a pleasant experience, I wouldn’t say it was painful either. It felt like a sting and slight burn…. The whole thing took about 30 seconds. Honestly, doctors see this stuff all the time and you shouldn’t feel ashamed to go see one to get your wart taken care of.  You’re definitely not going to be the first or last genital wart the doctor looks at so you really shouldn’t feel embarrassed. 

Here’s a summary of the aftercare experience - 
Right after the procedure it hurt and was just really tender and sore. When I got home I took extra strength Tylenol and laid down and felt fine. The area she treated looked swollen and the warts looked dark purple/black for an hour or so. Later that night it still was swollen but the warts turned red. The soreness and tenderness was still there, but not as bad as the first hour or so.  For the next couple days the area felt a little tender, but not really that painful.  I kept the area covered in Aquifer ointment and taped some gauze over it so it wouldn’t rub against my clothes.  The blister eventually scabbed up and felt crusty and hard, but didn’t hurt.  Then exactly one week after the procedure I was able to very gently pull the scab off - the warts were completely gone!  The area that got treated was a little red, but I kept putting Aquifer on it to help moisturize the fresh skin and the redness keeps getting better.  The scar will eventually fade to nothing and the warts are gone.

TLDR - warts are common and easily treated.  After about a week after cryotherapy they were gone.  Don’t be embarrassed and go see a doctor already."	1
"Essay from Josh Lerner, MD after the CDC loosens guidelines for all of us on the front lines 
“In one of the most vivid scenes in the HBO miniseries ""Chernobyl"" (among many vivid scenes), soldiers dressed in leather smocks ran out into radioactive areas to literally shovel radioactive material out of harm's way. Horrifically under-protected, they suited up anyway. In another scene, soldiers fashioned genital protection from scrap metal out of desperation while being sent to other hazardous areas.

Please don't tell me that in the richest country in the world in the 21st century, I'm supposed to work in a fictionalized Soviet-era disaster zone and fashion my own face mask out of cloth because other Americans hoard supplies for personal use and so-called leaders sit around in meetings hearing themselves talk. I ran to a bedside the other day to intubate a crashing, likely COVID, patient. Two respiratory therapists and two nurses were already at the bedside. That's 5 N95s masks, 5 gowns, 5 face shields and 10 gloves for one patient at one time. I saw probably 15-20 patients that shift, if we are going to start rationing supplies, what percentage should I wear precautions for?

Make no mistake, the CDC is loosening these guidelines because our country is not prepared. Loosening guidelines increases healthcare workers' risk but the decision is done to allow us to keep working, not to keep us safe. It is done for the public benefit - so I can continue to work no matter the personal cost to me or my family (and my healthcare family). Sending healthcare workers to the front line asking them to cover their face with a bandana is akin to sending a soldier to the front line in a t-shirt and flip flops.

I don't want talk. I don't want assurances. I want action. I want boxes of N95s piling up, donated from the people who hoarded them. I want non-clinical administrators in the hospital lining up in the ER asking if they can stock shelves to make sure that when I need to rush into a room, the drawer of PPE equipment I open isn't empty. I want them showing up in the ER asking ""how can I help"" instead of offering shallow ""plans"" conceived by someone who has spent far too long in an ivory tower and not long enough in the trenches. Maybe they should actually step foot in the trenches.

I want billion-dollar companies like 3M halting all production of any product that isn't PPE to focus on PPE manufacturing. I want a company like Amazon, with its logistics mastery (it can drop a package to your door less than 24 hours after ordering it), halting its 2-day delivery of 12 reams of toilet paper to whoever is willing to pay the most in order to help get the available PPE supply distributed fast and efficiently in a manner that gets the necessary materials to my brothers and sisters in arms who need them.

I want Proctor and Gamble, and the makers of other soaps and detergents, stepping up too. We need detergent to clean scrubs, hospital linens and gowns. We need disinfecting wipes to clean desk and computer surfaces. What about plastics manufacturers? Plastic gowns aren't some high-tech device, they are long shirts/smocks...made out of plastic. Get on it. Face shields are just clear plastic. Nitrile gloves? Yeah, they are pretty much just gloves...made from something that isn't apparently Latex. Let's go. Money talks in this country. Executive millionaires, why don't you spend a few bucks to buy back some of these masks from the hoarders, and drop them off at the nearest hospital.

I love biotechnology and research but we need to divert viral culture media for COVID testing and research. We need biotechnology manufacturing ready and able to ramp up if and when treatments or vaccines are developed. Our Botox supply isn't critical, but our antibiotic supply is. We need to be able to make more plastic ET tubes, not more silicon breast implants.

Let's see all that. Then we can all talk about how we played our part in this fight. Netflix and chill is not enough while my family, friends and colleagues are out there fighting. Our country won two world wars because the entire country mobilized. We out-produced and we out-manufactured while our soldiers out-fought the enemy. We need to do that again because make no mistake, we are at war, healthcare workers are your soldiers, and the war has just begun.”

**Facts:**

Vaxart will be hosting a Key Opinion Leader Webinar on Monday, May 3 at 12:00pm EST. If there is any new information the company will be disclosing, they will need to release an SEC filing prior to the webinar. It could come at 8:30am EST, it could be 30 minutes before the webinar. Vaxart plans to present new data comparing T-Cell responses from their vaccine candidate compared to other vaccines (Moderna, Pfizer, JNJ) along with new mucosal antibody data results that suggest Vaxart's vaccine is potentially protective against new and emerging strains of the Rona.

Source: [https://investors.vaxart.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vaxart-host-key-opinion-leader-webinar-importance-t-cell](https://investors.vaxart.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vaxart-host-key-opinion-leader-webinar-importance-t-cell)

After they present the data, a non-smooth brain named Dr. Mark Davis will talk about T-cells and why they are important. More about this in a minute. Dr. Davis was educated at John Hopkins, received his PhD at Cal Tech, and has been teaching and researching at Stanford since 1985. He is the Director of the Stanford Human Systems Immunology Center. He's solved some major mysteries on T-cells over the years and even created a system of labeling t-cells according to the molecules they recognize, kind of like the Dewey Decimal system for books, only with T-cells. This process is used all over the world when running experiments and trials. He's authored 407 scientific publications, most on immunology and t-cells. He has 9 patents on T-cells for processes and devices.

**Option Papa’s Opinions and Smooth Brain Understanding:**

Dr. Davis is a pioneer in the field and has remained on the cutting edge for 35+ years. He is among the top experts in the world on the subject of T-cells...let's get back to them. Anti-bodies are like army soldiers walking off the field of combat. Your body got infected, your body fought back and won, the anti-bodies are evidence of the viral infection, the battle and the immune system’s victory. Cytotoxic T-cells (also called killer T-cells) prevent infection from taking root on the surface of infection throughout the body, but for Vaxart specifically in the mucous linings of your mouth, nose, lungs, and eyes.

As the Rona lands on those places, with anti-bodies your body would notice an infection is occurring and begin to assemble anti-bodies to do battle with the infection, all the while the virus is invading more and more cells and spreading. Killer T-cells are like air superiority in a ground war. They see the rona has landed and instead of waiting for the army to assemble and march, the T cells are a Predator Drones, buzzing around 24/7, they notice the viral incursion, swoops in and drop a payload at the site of infection. There's no wounded soldiers (anti-bodies) as evidence the fight happened, because the T-cells came in and destroyed the virus when it landed on their territory - the mucosal areas. This prevents the virus from taking root and the body becoming infected. 

[https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/antibodies-t-cells-protect-against-sars-cov-2](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/antibodies-t-cells-protect-against-sars-cov-2)

[https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/antibodies-fight-off-the-new-coronavirus-but-what-do-t-cells-do](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/antibodies-fight-off-the-new-coronavirus-but-what-do-t-cells-do)

Dr. Davis will likely make the case that herd immunity will be very difficult to achieve without elevated T-cell responses in the whole population, because T-cells likely cross protect against all variants, unlike some of the other vaccines that are variant specific, attacking the spike protein, which mutates often and creates new variants.

Vaxart will reiterate the issues of cold chain storage and transportation, vial mixing, syringes, doctor/nurse administered vaccines, especially in 3rd world countries that are currently being ravaged by COVID. Those countries do not have the infrastructure to administer billions of vaccines and while they try, the virus will be mutating and wreaking havoc that may spread back to first world countries. They will also likely reinforce their vaccine was more thoughtfully designed, as it was planned to attack the spike and N protein which doesn't mutate much. Vaxart's vaccines in theory can have faster distribution, longer lasting protection and equitable access the world over.

**Herb Brooks Contributions:**

Richetti:

Jeff Richetti is Vaxart’s lobbyist. He’s also the brother of Biden’s former Chief of Staff and current Senior Counselor (Biden’s right hand man with full access to Biden and the White House). This gives Vaxart almost direct access to Biden. There’s no one closer to Biden then his Senior Counselor.

The Senior Counselor has a huge role in the WH and has “unrestricted access to the President.”:

“Mr. Ricchetti, 63, has been a key player in Mr. Biden’s life since joining the vice president’s staff in 2012, but his dogged efforts on behalf of a candidate many viewed as past his prime \*\*\*ensured he would have a powerful, free-ranging role in the Biden White House.”

“He is one of the president-elect’s most loyal advisers, and someone Mr. Biden will almost certainly turn to in times of crisis or in stressful moments. And Tuesday, in a widely anticipated move, Mr. Biden named Mr. Ricchetti his counselor, \*\*\*a position that typically confers relatively UNRESTRICTED ACCESS to the president.”

Keep in mind that Vaxart has many connections to the Biden Admin that can possibly help them win a vax dev funding deal or downstream large-scale vax order or even a platform licensing deal for what Vaxart has sometimes referred to as their “The Rapid Pandemic Response Platform”.

These connections include:

\-Dr. David Kessler, Biden’s Covid-19 Response Chief Science Officer is from UCSF 13 miles from Vaxart; UCSF has a vibrant mucosal immunology program. Hard to think they haven’t crossed paths.

\-Ron Klain, Biden Chief of Staff was the former Obama Ebola Czar in 2014-2015 when Vaxart and US Army/US Govt built an Ebola vax pill together and the Army tested it in mice and NHP trials

\-Rick Bright, Biden Covid Advisory Board Member is a Former Obama-era BARDA Director. He led the Influenza division when the BARDA CIADM network was established and when Emergent took over the CIADM that Vaxart is slated to manufacture in. He also led the BARDA  Influenza Division when Vaxart won a $15mln Flu Pill Testing contract from the US Govt and he was Director of BARDA when that contract was later expanded in 2017. He also was director of BARDA when J&J won a big Influenza/Universal Influenza contract (J&J and Vaxart have an early univ flu  collab) and when Emergent expanded the CIADM in 2017.

Market Cap:

Motley has a piece on Vaxart’s potential future market cap - [https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/investing/2021/02/12/what-is-vaxart-worth-now/](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/investing/2021/02/12/what-is-vaxart-worth-now/)

RA Capital sees the market for combo Flu/Covid vaccines as $10-$20BLN/year. If Vaxart can get 20% market share and $2-$4BLN/year in sales they might be looking at a market cap of $20BLN-$40BLN at a 10x price-to-sales ratio and that excludes other pipeline programs, long-term government contracts for vax stockpiling or platform licensing, and potential biopharma licensing deals. This also assumes a low market share % despite a vax pill’s potential to command dominant market share given its distribution advantages in developing nations and the likelihood it achieves higher consumer acceptance rates and vaccination rates due to convenience and a superior customer experience. Governments and people should prefer the pill. It has the potential to make injectables obsolete in the coming years and could lead to possible near-monopoly market share.

**ProbablyStoned contribution**: 

Many of you who have done your research have probably stumbled upon information regarding Vaxart and lawsuits. This can get quite confusing. 

Initially, June 26th, Vaxart released a PR titled ""Vaxart's COVID-19 Vaccine Selected for the U.S. Government's Operation Warp Speed."" Investors mistakenly assumed that automatically meant Vaxart was getting funded or compensated by OWS. However, in the press release, in detail, they explain how they were going to test their pill I'm NHP (primate) studies. Upon reading the PR, Vaxart does not even touch on the subject of funding or compensation. The press release was blunt and straight to the point, as it should be. 

However, the media, somehow mistakenly accidently reported to retailers that ""the company had falsely claimed to be receiving support from Operation Warp Speed."" Shocker! The ambulance chasers of the stock world came running in, and filed an amended complaint alleging that the company issued misleading statements. But….they didn't. Media said they did. They reported falsely….just like the positive p1 results. 

But that's not all, on June 25, 2020, the media said that vaxart partnered with Atwill Medical Solutions to manufacture a billion or more pills per year of the covid vaccine for the US, Europe, and all the other countries in dire need. At the time of the PR, atwill wasn't certified to produce vaccines. This was one day before the OWS PR. Investors of VXRT alleged that this increased the share price nearly by 100%. 

Regarding the June 26th PR, the release noted that Vaxart would be participating in a nonhuman primate challenge study that ""in reality was a tangentially related U.S. government side program,"" the investors claim. BUT, Vaxart was not selected for the U.S. Government's Operation Warp Speed or funding with the NHP studies. By claiming to be 'one of the few companies selected by Operation Warp Speed' at a time when the identities of the remaining two or three pharmaceutical companies actually selected were still a secret yet to be revealed to the public, defendants again materially misled the market,"" according to the amended complaint, which states that Vaxart's share price surged another 28% on the news.

The last issue was the insider trading misconception that occurred between Vaxart and Armistice Capital. Armistice during this time while the stock price increased astronomically to sell 27 million shares of VXRT for about $267M. A month after this, the NYTimes published an article which reported that vaxart was NOT part of the OWS initiative, causing the share price to decrease 10%. Soon after, on August 19, Moncef Slaoui reported that some companies has “misled shareholders by tying themselves to OWS in order to drive up their share price, he was referring to Vaxart. This led the stock to drop another 5%. 

Vaxart responded to the June 25th and June 26th claims about OWS. The company said that investors had MISCHARACTERIZED the June 25/26 PRs. 

Regarding the Atwill part, “the first press release was a forward-looking statement that reflected Vaxart's ""'intent to establish \[Attwill\] as a resource for … manufacturing' its vaccine, if and when the vaccine was successfully developed.""

Regarding the OWS announcement, the PR was 100% transparent. The PR stated that Vaxart has been selected to participate in NHP studies funded by OWS. Vaxart replied, “it can't be accused of fraud just because the release didn't explain that participating in the study didn't mean Vaxart was receiving federal funding for its vaccine development. Nowhere in the 58-page \[amended complaint\] is there a single Vaxart statement that hints at its receipt of federal compensation,"" the company argued, asking that the claims be DISMISSED. 

Armistice Capital is also seeking dismissal of the lawsuit, stating the fact that Armistice had less than a 10% stake in the company on June 25th, and that Armistice just simply was realizing gains, not inside trading. 

""In the face of these straightforward facts — an investor buying low and selling high — plaintiffs manufactured an alleged 'pump-and-dump' scheme premised on statements Vaxart never made,"" the hedge fund said. ""This story is patently false.""

Both Vaxart and Armistice Capital are calling for a dismissal of the lawsuit. The final

"There's media promulgation that attacks vitamin D, but very little that even slightly pushes concern with aluminium compounds (literally neurotoxic, (they're put there with purpose to cause irritation) in vaccines. So, let me get this straight, injecting an agreed upon neurotoxic (consensus) in a form/compound that is known to still be neurotoxic and that's purpose is to cause aggrevation to the body to draw attention, is fine and dandy.

But.. having vitamin d, something we've eaten for millions of years and consumed through liver, in large quantities and have adapted to deal with sudden influxes and high dosage from long existing cultural practices (eating raw liver), is something that should be seen as dangerous? (I get that it's not like they're saying it's useless and always dangerous, but to even have this inconsistency in concern is unbelievable and should show any rational person just how upsidedown our culture of health and wellness is)."	0

*\[What you need to know to start the day:* [*Get New York Today in your inbox*](https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/newyorktoday?module=inline)*.\]*

ALBANY — The Legislature in New York, epicenter of the nation’s measles outbreak, on Thursday ended religious and other nonmedical exemptions for immunizations, overcoming vocal opposition from vaccine skeptics and advocates for religious freedom.

The Legislature’s approval added New York to a small handful of states that do not allow [exemptions on religious grounds](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/27/us/measles-vaccine-exemptions.html?searchResultPosition=1&module=inline), including California, West Virginia, Mississippi and Arizona.

The issue is particularly germane in New York, where many measles cases have originated in Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn and in Rockland County, where [so-called vaccine symposiums](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/nyregion/measles-vaccine-orthodox-jews.html?module=inline) have featured speakers that encouraged people to shun vaccines.

The measure in New York had been stalled for years because of sensitivity about ultra-Orthodox groups, which have often wielded political influence, as well as intense efforts by organizations like the Robert F. Kennedy Jr.-led Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vaccination group.

Those forces were on sharp display as the measure headed to a vote before the Democrat-controlled Legislature — especially in the State Assembly, which had been the stumbling block to passage. The floor debate on Thursday was unusually contentious, with lawmakers giving impassioned speeches weighing health concerns against parental and First Amendment rights.

“This is the hardest decision I’m going to be making in my 17 years here,” said Assemblyman Andrew P. Raia, a Long Island Republican who voted no.

The bill narrowly passed the Assembly, 77 to 53. The State Senate approved the bill soon after, and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed it, saying that religious freedom does not trump public health concerns.

The Assembly vote included the rare cajoling of Democratic votes by the Assembly leader, Carl E. Heastie, who watched nervously as the numbers crept slowly toward the 76-vote threshold needed for passage.

As soon as it did, the vote was called and shouts of “shame” — and more colorful invective — erupted from the Assembly gallery, where opponents had gathered to watch the proceedings. Assemblyman Jeffrion L. Aubry attempted to restore order, but the screams continued; unable to stop the shouting, Mr. Aubry took the chamber into recess as furious opponents headed into Capitol hallways.

The current measles outbreak has spread to 28 states, with more than 1,000 cases in total, the highest number since 1992, when more than 2,000 cases were recorded. Highly contagious, measles can serious complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis, according to the Centers for Disease Control.

A measles outbreak in 2015 in California led that state to [revoke nonmedical exemptions](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/us/california-mandates-vaccines-for-schoolchildren.html?module=inline). But lawmakers there are now considering tightening those restrictions and forcing parents to seek medical exemptions from the state Department of Public Health, instead of doctors.

The proposal gained attention this week when the actress Jessica Biel met with California lawmakers to lobby against the measure; she said in an Instagram post on Thursday that she supported vaccinations, but believed that families should have the “right to make educated medical decisions for their children alongside their physicians.”

Once a commonplace disease for millions of children each year, measles was declared eliminated in 2000 after several decades of widespread vaccination. But the current outbreak has alarmed both state and national health officials, as well as medical advocates.

On Thursday, for example, the American Medical Association announced it would step up its efforts to “incentivize states to eliminate nonmedical exemptions.” The association also said it would support state bills allowing minors to ask for vaccinations even if their parents refuse, which is the subject of [another bill pending](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/11/nyregion/measles-vaccination-laws-ny.html?module=inline) in New York.

The immunization bill considered on Thursday would eliminate an exemption for any parent or guardian who holds “genuine and sincere religious beliefs” against immunization. During the 2017-18 school year, 26,217 students in public, private and parochial schools, child care centers, nursery schools and prekindergarten programs in New York State had religious exemptions, according to the State Department of Health.

On Thursday, the health department reiterated that “immunizations give children the best protection from serious childhood diseases and are safe and effective,” but officials also seemed cognizant of ongoing skepticism in some quarters.

“The New York State Department of Health will continue our extensive public outreach campaign to educate people on the facts about vaccinations and to counter misinformation that has fueled this outbreak,” said Jill Montag, a department spokeswoman.

State Senator Brad Hoylman, the sponsor of the bill in that chamber, cast the bill as an effort to fight debunked online theories about vaccines causing autism and other harmful side effects.

“There is a public health crisis underway and New York is the epicenter,” said Mr. Hoylman, a Democrat from Manhattan. “And numbers continue to grow because well-intentioned parents are being misinformed by anti-vax conspiracy theorists. And it’s part of the state’s responsibility to make sure everyone is safe in schools and day care centers.”

In another moment of legislative drama, the bill was nearly derailed by the Assembly health committee on Thursday, passing only after a member, Nader J. Sayegh, a Yonkers Democrat, changed his vote to yes to break a tie and to allow the bill to proceed. Mr. Sayegh voted no on the bill once it proceeded to the floor, but said he believed “the public and the Assembly at large deserves an opportunity to vote on this matter.”

Mr. Heastie had attended the committee meeting to help usher the bill to the floor, in an indication of how close the vote was expected to be.

As members Assembly health committee members entered their meeting on the bill Thursday morning, activists chanted, “Please vote no!” and held handmade placards reading “Protect 1st Amendment: God’s Watching.”

Opponents then crowded into the meeting itself, some carrying newborns and small children. Several opponents cried when the measure passed out of committee.

At the committee hearing, the bill’s sponsor, Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz, a Bronx Democrat, argued that California’s actions had helped boost vaccination rates there, and have helped fend off future outbreaks of the measles, which can be fatal in rare cases. “Vaccinations have saved countless millions of lives,” he said.

Later, as opponents of the bill filled the Assembly gallery, several lawmakers described wrestling with a complicated decision, pitting parental prerogative and public health.

Assemblyman Michael Montesano, a Long Island Republican, saw the issue in starker terms, calling it “an attack on people’s First Amendment rights.” He added, “It’s still the individual parent, who is raising this child, that has the fundamental right to decide what happens with their child in all facets of their life.”

Others cast their votes in personal terms. Kenneth Zebrowski, an assemblyman from Rockland County, noted that his county had 266 confirmed cases, with more than a dozen hospitalizations. He also noted his 1-year-old daughter had to accelerate her vaccinations because of the outbreak there.

“Our job is not just to react to epidemics,” Mr. Zebrowski said. “Our job as legislators is to prevent epidemics.”

Mr. Dinowitz seconded this, stressing that his bill was not simply a reaction to the current outbreak, noting that he first introduced it in 2015.

“The purpose of the bill,” he said, “is to protect people.”

How common is Penile Cancer? Hi, I've recently been diagnosed with HPV and was wondering how common penile cancer is? I only started to have sex last year so the virus isn't a year old yet. (I'm a heavy Marijuana smoker) Are there any signs? I feel like I have a bump on the side of my penis but tbh I might just be paranoid. I've also recently been diagnosed with bronchitis. Is it common to have respiratory problems for people with the virus? 	0
"Every single person I know had a side effect from the mRNA vaccines. My mum who is in absolutely amazing health took the vaccine and the next day she has a swollen calf god knows what that could be.

Brother took two shots and had tinnitus. What on earth of a mechanism would cause that? Explain I'd like your input. 

Grandad died from heart failure a month after the shot but ok he's old right so it can't be the vaccine noooo way!

Grandmother at this very moment is in a home for dementia she got put in there eerily close to her vaccination. 

Sister had a mild headache. 

THIS COULD OF BEEN YOU! That's right you could be sitting here with a debilitating problem from a vaccine and because you're to weak you'd have absolutely no chance in fighting the problem.

"Is It Possible to Get a Flu Shot Too Early?  “The incentives in the private sector are not necessarily aligned with public health,” Lipsitch said.   
""And drugstores and supermarkets are motivated to immunize people sooner rather than later because if they don’t, customers might go somewhere else or do without, said Marc Lipsitch, PhD, an epidemiology professor who focuses on infectious diseases at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.""  


I have been uneasy at the relentless pushing of flu vaccine by grocery stores. One year, I went urgent care at Walgreen for an ear infection, and the Nurse Practitioner pushed the flu vaccine really hard, which I took, even though it was counter-indicated when you are sick.  
When you push vaccines for commercial reasons, it undermines public confidence and creates the type of suspicion that fuels the antivax movement.

"A Happy Disclosure Story Hi all, I wanted to post with a happy disclosure story today. I've previously posted about my bad luck with disclosing GW; in general, I've found that potential male partners don't know much or anything about HPV and are a bit freaked out. The responses I've had have ranged from anger to pity. I've experimented with saying something immediately and waiting a bit. Saying it upfront tended to have the worst outcomes, so I decided to get to know people first before disclosing anything. 

I actually took a break from dating because a recurrence a few weeks ago set me back. I was overwhelmed with the fear of disclosing, plus needing to discuss some other health stuff that I've got going on that can impact my sex life.

Something made me jump back in. I went on a few dates with someone I like, and he expressed interest in taking things further, which I wanted too. I knew I needed to have the chat, but I was super nervous about it. 

I explained that I have low risk HPV. Normally this is the point where I say, 'I don't know if you know much about HPV. If you don't, I've read a lot about it so I'm happy to fill you in'. And normally they don't know anything and the conversation takes a turn. But he said, 'Oh, yeah, I know all about it! We've all had HPV! My ex had an abnormal smear so I researched it. 99% of the time it doesn't cause any problems.' I made sure he understood the difference between high and low risk, and he did. Then he said he didn't think I had any need to be uncomfortable or afraid around him. 

It was such a refreshing change from usual and reminded me that there are people out there who understand."	0

"Who volunteers for vaccine trials? Now that we are starting to talk about Covid19 vaccine trials, I realize that it may not entirely be a very safe process for the volunteers themselves since they eventually get exposed to a real virus especially the ones with placebo vaccine. Covid19 is still less deadly compared to other viruses like Ebola. So there is a good chance that a volunteer gets exposed to an Ebola virus when they have only gotten a placebo vaccine correct? If so, who actually would volunteer for these trials? 

Note: None of the above is to question the process or raise any questions about vaccines or their safety. I am simply trying to understand the trial process."	0

"Results presented at 2 conferences on 3107 show RRP surgery reduction effectiveness- Call offers at $10 & $7; Put offers at $8 & $9- for 11/15 monthly expiration. Is this the runway to launching 5401, 3112, 3100, 4800, dLNP and dMAB enhancing agents, etc.? ""At AACR's *Tumor and Immunology* *Conference* on October 19, INOVIO presented new immunology data demonstrating the ability of INO-3107 to induce antigen-specific T cell responses against HPV-6 and HPV-11 and drive recruitment of those T cells into airway tissues and papilloma of RRP patients, which could ultimately slow or eliminate papilloma regrowth. Additionally, INOVIO will tomorrow present its full safety and efficacy data set for the Phase 1/2 trial for INO-3107 at the *International Society of Vaccines Conference*. In the trial, INO-3107 was found to be well tolerated and immunogenic. Of the 32 patients in the trial, 26 patients, or 81%, experienced a decrease in the number of surgical interventions in the year after treatment when compared to the year before treatment.

""The new immunology data support the proposed mechanism of action of INO-3107 which is to generate an immune response that can seek out and eliminate HPV-6 and HPV-11 infected cells that are the underlying cause of papilloma growth,"" said Dr. Matthew Morrow, INOVIO's Vice President of Translational Science. ""Our analysis shows that INO-3107 induced significant clonal T cell expansion in the blood, including antigen-specific killer T cells. Investigators also observed T cell infiltration into airway tissue, which is positively associated with clinical response.""

""The collective story these data sets provide is compelling. Over 81% of patients who received INO-3107 required fewer surgical procedures compared to baseline, a result that is further supported by the new immunology data demonstrating the ability of INO-3107 to stimulate the immune system and generate antigen-specific T cells that travel to the airways and could eliminate the underlying disease,"" said Dr. Jacqueline Shea, INOVIO's President and Chief Executive Officer. ""We believe these data continue to demonstrate that INO-3107 has the potential to significantly improve the lives of patients living with RRP and become the preferred choice for the broadest number of RRP patients and healthcare providers.""

**Summary of Data Presented at Conferences**

**AACR Special Conference in Cancer Research: Tumor Immunology and Immunotherapy**  
**Abstract:** *Reduction in Surgical Interventions for the Treatment of Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis by INO-3107 is Associated with Enriched Macrophage, Dendritic cell and T cell Signatures in Patient Airways*

New Immunology data for INO-3107 demonstrated: 

* Induction of T cell responses specifically for HPV-6 and HPV-11
* Expansion of antigen specific, clonal T cell populations in peripheral blood
* Induction of inflammatory responses in papilloma and airway tissue, including:
   * Interferon, cytokine and chemokine signaling
   * Adaptive and innate immune cell infiltration, with emphasis on T cells
* Cytotoxic signatures of infiltrated T cells in papilloma/airway tissue, providing direct evidence of increased overall T cell infiltration compared to pre-treatment
* Clinical activity not impacted by immunosuppressive papilloma microenvironment

**International Society of Vaccines Conference**  
**Abstract***: Clinical Assessment of Adjuvant Immunotherapy, INO-3107, in Adult Patients with Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP)*

Clinical Results of Phase 1/2 Study with INO-3107 in Adult RRP Patients  
In the trial, the overall clinical response (OCR) was 81%, with 26 of the 32 enrolled patients experiencing a decrease in the number of surgical interventions in the year after INO-3107 administration compared to the prior year, including 28% (9/32) that required no surgical intervention (i.e., complete response or ""CR"") during or after the dosing window. Further, 44% (14/32) of patients had a partial response (""PR""), measured by a reduction of at least 50%, but less than 100%, in the number of surgeries when compared to the prior year. The overall response rate (ORR) of patients (CR+PR) was therefore 72% (23/32).

Other key data points presented include:

* INO-3107 was well tolerated and immunogenic in the 32 patients enrolled
   * 41% (13/32) of patients reported a treatment-related Adverse Event (AE)
   * Most frequent treatment-related AE's reported were injection site pain (31%) and fatigue (9%)
   * No treatment-related AEs greater than Grade 2 severity were reported
* Modified Derkay-Pransky severity scores improved from baseline to the end of 52-week trial
* INO-3107 induced durable cellular responses and generated T cells against HPV-6 and HPV-11"""	1
"I don't want it but.. It seems everyone and I mean everyone I know is getting or is waiting to get the vaccine.  I really don't want to.  It's not fda approved and is basically an experiment at this point in time.  

Are this many people seriously just sheep?  Media says they need it and they look down on those who may question it?  Scientists are changing the narrative daily.  Literally everyone I know from my wife to siblings to friends to coworkers to acquaintances are like...when are you getting your vaccine???  And it annoys me so. 

This could cause major riffles in my family life and potentially employment.

"Vaxxers are less and less often denying vaccines cause autism, simply because it's becoming increasingly difficult to justify, as evidence spreads, and information becomes more accessible. They now have moved to saying, instead, that they'd rather have autism, than die. Which is a false dichotomy. Soon they'll move to, ''Ok yeah, some vaccines put me at more risk than the diseases they're for would ever, but I'd rather get brain damaged by dead or attenuated viruses, than wild viruses because wild viruses creep me out more."""	-1
"Can’t have sex now So at this point I’m 99% sure I have HPV/Genital Warts. Obviously I don’t want to pass it on to anybody so I won’t be having sex until a while after the bumps are gone. I want to be responsible.

I just can’t help but feel like I’ve been robbed of something though. I’m 21 and was starting to make life moves (like getting my own apartment) that would have allowed me to finally start having a lot more sex. I’ve had sex a few times but the number of times is under 40 over 2 years and tbh I was really looking forward to finally being able to explore sex and have a sex filled life. Not to mention the fact that I lost my virginity at an older age (19). Any advice or words of encouragement?

P.S. the girl who I’m 90% sure gave me HPV seems to be unaware that she has it, even though she has bumps herself (stupid to have had sex with her I know but my sexual education was trash) and she didn’t take precautions when we had sex, didn’t tell me she might have HPV, she even wanted me to fuck her without a condom. She could be lying about not knowing she has HPV but that would be even more naive than me having sex with her when I thought something about her vulva looked off. She literally asked me who I thought I got it from when I called her to talk about it (It definitely adds to the feeling of being robbed of a normal sex life). I don’t even want to think that she might have knowingly had sex with me during an active HPV outbreak."	0
"No Fault' Compensation for Vaccine Injury Claims  I saw this post earlier today. And it's a question I hear often about vaccines, so I wanted to address it. 

https://preview.redd.it/vxh2rvp859ra1.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=08d28d988e1242ec138e528cdfd9bf255b68c4aa

The reason we use a no-fault compensation system is because the standard legal process lead to bad outcomes for everyone (including plaintiffs).

US courts are not reliable adjudicators of medical claims--judges and lawyers aren't doctors--so what would happen is the large majority of people suing would lose their case, after years of expensive legal struggles, and the people who won did so more by luck and legal opinion than by having a more valid medical claim than other plaintiffs.

Likewise: vaccines also aren't a huge profit center for pharma (vs other drugs) so many companies pulled out of the market rather than deal with the randomness. This literally lead to vaccine shortages in the 80s. So not only were very few people compensated under this system, but also people who wanted to get vaccinated could not.

The no-fault system was a policy solution that made it easier for individuals claiming to be vaccine injured to get compensation, by lowering the standard of evidence necessary. And to be clear: *you can sue the pharmaceutical company* *if you lose your case here.* It's just that most people who go through this system don't.

It's not perfect but it's better than the alternative. More about this [here](https://aloveforlives.substack.com/p/adverse-events-discourse#:~:text=COVID%20Vaccine%20Injury%20Compensation)."	0
"High Risk HPV Exposure in Males Questions I’m sorry if I seem odd but I’m kind of am freaking out and can use some help/encouragement. 

Before we had unprotected vaginal sex we got STD tests done and both came back negative. She did get a Pap smear done that came back as “High Risk HPV Abnormalities”.

I saw my Primary Care Physician and he wasn’t much help and contradicted everything I read online and on this Reddit page. I also spoke with a Nurse Practitioner as well. And tomorrow I’m talking to my Health Departments STD Clinic to confirm the information.

We had oral sex 5 times and sex with a condom 3 times. Never had unprotected sex via penis.

I also just told my parents and now I feel like I’m fighting a panic attack. I go in and out of I’m fine to I’m doomed.

I do have some questions and maybe you guys can help me:

1.) Is the Pap smear a HPV Test?

2.) Am I at risk of carrying the same High Risk HPV abnormalities

3.) Is this for Life?

4.) How is High Risk HPV Transmitted?

5.) My doctor said it’s unlikely I would get HPV from Oral Sex, is this true? He said it’s more likely I would be from when the penis brushes the infected cervix

6.) Who can I see for more information?

7.) Were the cases around 90% clearing up in 2 years not related high risk

8.) Would any future partners be at risk?

"Is it OK to refuse a recommended vaccination? The story is this; Back in the mid-90s, I live in Sweden, where my daughter was born, to me (an American) and a native Swede. We received a letter from the public health authorities telling us our daughter should be vaccinated against Tuberculosis. TB vaccination is not standard for children in Sweden, but because one of her parents was an ‘immigrant’ we were called in for this vaccination. 

The TB vaccine is not benign, it leaves a permeant scar. My other concern was that we were planning to move to the USA and I remembered having skin tests for TB in school every year when I was a child. If you have been vaccinated you will hit positive on a skin test. The risk for my daughter of contracting TB was very small and most strains of TB can be easily and effectively treated. The nurse who we had to talk to was not happy that we were refusing the vaccine, but relented in the face of our opposition. 

I am not anti-vaccine, my daughter received all of the other ‘regular’ childhood vaccines and when she was a pre-teen she was vaccinated against HPV, a new, less universal, vaccine. But I still think I made the right decision about the TB vaccine, even though some of my concern was based on wrong information- I don’t think that TB skin tests are still done routinely in US schools. 
All vaccines carry a risk of serious, possibly fatal, complications. The odds of a serious adverse reaction is very small. But everyone should be able to take their own chances. I will buy a Powerball lottery ticket today. The odds of my daughter (or myself) dying from a sudden adverse reaction to a vaccine is roughly 300 times greater than me winning Powerball. For me, the minuscule odds are worth $2, but for someone else, miniscule odds might not be worth risking their life. 

Vaccinations and the sometimes less than scientific public policy about vaccinations is not universally positive. I am not talking about the fears surrounding autism and MMR. Let’s first look at Polio. Church Bells rang on April 12th 1955 when it was announced that a safe an effective vaccine had been developed for Polio. It is not possible for those of us who grew-up after 1955 to fully understand the joy people felt at conquering this horrible disease. The original Salk vaccine, or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) was soon superseded by the Sabin Oral polio vaccine (OPV), an attenuated vaccine. The OPV vaccine is more effective and much easier to administer and was widely used. Between 1962 and 1965 about 100 million Americans (roughly 56% of the population at that time) received the Sabin vaccine. The problem is that OPV, can in rare cases, cause vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP), basically, giving you devastating polio. -1 case per 750,000 vaccine recipients. As of January 1, 2000, OPV was no longer recommended for routine immunization in the United States. 

Rare cases of VAPP was not the only problem on the way to defeating Polio in the US. Early on in the mass vaccination campaign, defective vaccine from Cutter Biologicals caused 153 cases of paralysis and 11 deaths. Much later, it was discovered that from 1955 to 1963 a proportion of vaccine was contaminated with SV40 virus. It has been estimated that 10–30 million Americans may have received a dose of vaccine contaminated with SV40, but adverse health effects of the virus are not conclusive. 

Equal disturbing is that public policy is not always dictated by firm science. The 1976 swine flu debacle was driven more by President Ford's re-election campaign than by sound public health policy. As a 13 year old middle school student, I convinced my parents to let me op-out of that mass vaccination program. The 1976 swine flu vaccine is thought to have possibly caused Guillain–Barré syndrome for 1 in 105,000 individuals. The dangers of the flu epidemic were greatly over estimated. A/New Jersey/1976 (H1N1) was detected only from January 19 to February 9 and did not spread beyond Fort Dix. Mass vaccination did not begin in the US until October 1st. 48,161,019 Americans, or just over 22% of the population, were vaccinated. Dick Cheney, who was Ford’s chief of staff at the time was a key driver behind the miss-guided policy. After 9-11, Cheney also advocated for mass vaccination against smallpox out of fear the pox would be used as a terrorist weapon. While it would have been foolish to vaccinate the whole population against smallpox in the absence of any credible threat, I was vaccinated against smallpox as a child, just one jab in the millions the wiped out the disease. I still have the scar. 

Just to recap, from the last to the first; I am glad my daughter was not forced to be vaccinated against smallpox because of Cheney’s paranoid ‘war on terror’ manipulations. I am glad I was vaccinated, even though a have a permanent scar, as a part of the campaign that ridded the world of this disease. I am glad I opted out of the ill-conceived, politically motivated 1976 swine-flu vaccination program. I am glad I was vaccinated against Polio, even though I may have been exposed to SV40, as the disease is now virtually wipe-out in the US. I am glad we refused the TB vaccine, the call for which was based on general non-specific demographic profiling- not our actual individual circumstances."	1

ALBANY — The Legislature in New York, epicenter of the nation’s measles outbreak, on Thursday ended religious and other nonmedical exemptions for immunizations, overcoming vocal opposition from vaccine skeptics and advocates for religious freedom.

The Legislature’s approval added New York to a small handful of states that do not allow [exemptions on religious grounds](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/27/us/measles-vaccine-exemptions.html?searchResultPosition=1&module=inline), including California, West Virginia, Mississippi and Arizona.

The issue is particularly germane in New York, where many measles cases have originated in Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn and in Rockland County, where [so-called vaccine symposiums](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/nyregion/measles-vaccine-orthodox-jews.html?module=inline) have featured speakers that encouraged people to shun vaccines.

The measure in New York had been stalled for years because of sensitivity about ultra-Orthodox groups, which have often wielded political influence, as well as intense efforts by organizations like the Robert F. Kennedy Jr.-led Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vaccination group.

Those forces were on sharp display as the measure headed to a vote before the Democrat-controlled Legislature — especially in the State Assembly, which had been the stumbling block to passage. The floor debate on Thursday was unusually contentious, with lawmakers giving impassioned speeches weighing health concerns against parental and First Amendment rights.

“This is the hardest decision I’m going to be making in my 17 years here,” said Assemblyman Andrew P. Raia, a Long Island Republican who voted no.

The bill narrowly passed the Assembly, 77 to 53. The State Senate approved the bill soon after, and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed it, saying that religious freedom does not trump public health concerns.

The Assembly vote included the rare cajoling of Democratic votes by the Assembly leader, Carl E. Heastie, who watched nervously as the numbers crept slowly toward the 76-vote threshold needed for passage.

As soon as it did, the vote was called and shouts of “shame” — and more colorful invective — erupted from the Assembly gallery, where opponents had gathered to watch the proceedings. Assemblyman Jeffrion L. Aubry attempted to restore order, but the screams continued; unable to stop the shouting, Mr. Aubry took the chamber into recess as furious opponents headed into Capitol hallways.

The current measles outbreak has spread to 28 states, with more than 1,000 cases in total, the highest number since 1992, when more than 2,000 cases were recorded. Highly contagious, measles can serious complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis, according to the Centers for Disease Control.

A measles outbreak in 2015 in California led that state to [revoke nonmedical exemptions](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/us/california-mandates-vaccines-for-schoolchildren.html?module=inline). But lawmakers there are now considering tightening those restrictions and forcing parents to seek medical exemptions from the state Department of Public Health, instead of doctors.

The proposal gained attention this week when the actress Jessica Biel met with California lawmakers to lobby against the measure; she said in an Instagram post on Thursday that she supported vaccinations, but believed that families should have the “right to make educated medical decisions for their children alongside their physicians.”

Once a commonplace disease for millions of children each year, measles was declared eliminated in 2000 after several decades of widespread vaccination. But the current outbreak has alarmed both state and national health officials, as well as medical advocates.

On Thursday, for example, the American Medical Association announced it would step up its efforts to “incentivize states to eliminate nonmedical exemptions.” The association also said it would support state bills allowing minors to ask for vaccinations even if their parents refuse, which is the subject of [another bill pending](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/11/nyregion/measles-vaccination-laws-ny.html?module=inline) in New York.

The immunization bill considered on Thursday would eliminate an exemption for any parent or guardian who holds “genuine and sincere religious beliefs” against immunization. During the 2017-18 school year, 26,217 students in public, private and parochial schools, child care centers, nursery schools and prekindergarten programs in New York State had religious exemptions, according to the State Department of Health.

On Thursday, the health department reiterated that “immunizations give children the best protection from serious childhood diseases and are safe and effective,” but officials also seemed cognizant of ongoing skepticism in some quarters.

“The New York State Department of Health will continue our extensive public outreach campaign to educate people on the facts about vaccinations and to counter misinformation that has fueled this outbreak,” said Jill Montag, a department spokeswoman.

State Senator Brad Hoylman, the sponsor of the bill in that chamber, cast the bill as an effort to fight debunked online theories about vaccines causing autism and other harmful side effects.

“There is a public health crisis underway and New York is the epicenter,” said Mr. Hoylman, a Democrat from Manhattan. “And numbers continue to grow because well-intentioned parents are being misinformed by anti-vax conspiracy theorists. And it’s part of the state’s responsibility to make sure everyone is safe in schools and day care centers.”

In another moment of legislative drama, the bill was nearly derailed by the Assembly health committee on Thursday, passing only after a member, Nader J. Sayegh, a Yonkers Democrat, changed his vote to yes to break a tie and to allow the bill to proceed. Mr. Sayegh voted no on the bill once it proceeded to the floor, but said he believed “the public and the Assembly at large deserves an opportunity to vote on this matter.”

Mr. Heastie had attended the committee meeting to help usher the bill to the floor, in an indication of how close the vote was expected to be.

As members Assembly health committee members entered their meeting on the bill Thursday morning, activists chanted, “Please vote no!” and held handmade placards reading “Protect 1st Amendment: God’s Watching.”

Opponents then crowded into the meeting itself, some carrying newborns and small children. Several opponents cried when the measure passed out of committee.

At the committee hearing, the bill’s sponsor, Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz, a Bronx Democrat, argued that California’s actions had helped boost vaccination rates there, and have helped fend off future outbreaks of the measles, which can be fatal in rare cases. “Vaccinations have saved countless millions of lives,” he said.

Later, as opponents of the bill filled the Assembly gallery, several lawmakers described wrestling with a complicated decision, pitting parental prerogative and public health.

Assemblyman Michael Montesano, a Long Island Republican, saw the issue in starker terms, calling it “an attack on people’s First Amendment rights.” He added, “It’s still the individual parent, who is raising this child, that has the fundamental right to decide what happens with their child in all facets of their life.”

Others cast their votes in personal terms. Kenneth Zebrowski, an assemblyman from Rockland County, noted that his county had 266 confirmed cases, with more than a dozen hospitalizations. He also noted his 1-year-old daughter had to accelerate her vaccinations because of the outbreak there.

“Our job is not just to react to epidemics,” Mr. Zebrowski said. “Our job as legislators is to prevent epidemics.”

Mr. Dinowitz seconded this, stressing that his bill was not simply a reaction to the current outbreak, noting that he first introduced it in 2015.

“The purpose of the bill,” he said, “is to protect people.”

"Asking People About Vaccine Status Question! My partner and I and two of our eligible kids are fully vaccinated now. My younger kids are begging to have a friend come over and play because we moved across the country just before the pandemic locked down and they've been unable to make friends for over a year. I have no problems with them bringing a friend home for awhile under one condition: their parents/eligible family members be vaccinated. 

Is it weird or is it okay to ask people you don't really know about their covid vaccine status? One family told me straight up that they have zero plans to vaccinate, and my child is okay with not having them over. But the other one ""thinks"" their parents got the vaccine, but isn't sure. Would y'all be okay if someone asked your vaccine status? I personally would feel relieved if someone asked in order to make sure their child was safer playing at my house, but I'm wondering how many others feel the same."	1
My step dad no longer wants to work because the government is make him get vaxxed or tested. Hello! I am F 19 who lives in the South. My step dad M 40 is a Rebuican who doesn't believe in the COVID vaccine, he thinks COVID is just like the flu and is overall and angry little guy. MY step dad got told by his work that because of the new law coming to pass, it's either get vaxxed or get tested. So my step dad is considering no longer working anywhere and just I guess living more broke than he actually does. He has no 401k as he took it out early to build a house, and he has taken out the parent plus loan so I can go to college. My step dad is so into Republican rhetoric that he would rather go full broke but also not take help from the government over 3 shots. Like boo hoo cracker get over it	0

Written by an Alabama Physician.

""I'm  admitting young healthy people to the hospital with very serious COVID  infections. One of the last things they do before they're intubated is  beg me for the vaccine.

*I hold their hand and tell them that I'm sorry,  but it's too late*. A few days later when I call time of death, I hug  their family members and I tell them the best way to honor their loved  one is to go get vaccinated and encourage everyone they know to do the  same.

They cry. And they tell me they didn't know. They thought it was a  hoax. They thought it was political. They thought because they had a  certain blood type or a certain skin color they wouldn't get as sick.  They thought it was 'just the flu'.

But they were wrong. And they wish  they could go back. But they can't. So they thank me and they go get the  vaccine. And I go back to my office, write their death note, and say a  small prayer that this loss will save more lives.""

It's definitely worth the read, and a reminder that it's pretty clear Covid is now a pandemic of the unvaccinated. However, this physician's take is pretty compassionate and she does not bear ill will toward these patients. "	1
"Second Opinion? I am 25, vaccinated with regular Gardasil and Gardasil 4 in 2015. I had my first abnormal pap smear test with a positive High Risk (strain 59) HPV test in February 2023. My doctor recommended me for colposcopy, that she preformed in April alongside with 2 biopsies. 

My results came back as CIN1, she recommended that I come back for another pap test in about a year. I've read that chances of regressing are really high within the first 2 years. I've only started becoming sexually active early 2020 and have only had one partner. Unfortunately, I got Covid pre-vaccine Dec 2020 and again April 2022. I can only assume that my chances of my immune system fighting it off decreased tremendously. By my math, I've most likely have had HPV for the past 3 years and still testing positive. 

Did anyone get the same response by their doctor to wait a year for a follow up? or did you get a second opinion?"	0

"""Pandemic of the unvaccinated"" as a term is so elitest and condescending The new CDC guidelines reversed its stance on masking and their latest leaked slides shows a possible bad summer and a grim fall season ahead. 

&#x200B;

As much as I understand the angst and anger some of us are feeling right now, I feel that the narrative of blaming the people for not getting vaccinated is not constructive and counterproductive. 

Imagine you are in the fence regarding the vaccine (yes, those people exist), and all you are hearing is this condescending messaging thrown at you mixed with some culture war bullshit, how would you react? 

&#x200B;

Falling back on what we have regarding the unvaccinated, I found this nicely written [article from KFF detailing the characteristics of the unvaxxed](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-profile-of-the-unvaccinated/). 

&#x200B;

Some people vehemently oppose getting a COVID vaccine, and as a matter of a fact, they are not putting any vaccine in their bodies, and I don't if there is any amount of messaging or out-reach going to change their mind.

&#x200B;

But the interesting part is that there are a slice of the community that is still on the fence and those can be reached and saved, not mocked and degraded.

"Half vaxxed person here with Asthma update Hey just posting for support and mutual    sharing of this scary experience.

I’ve had asthma my entire life - I decided that getting vaxxed was the right thing to do for someone who already has a compromised respiratory system. I wanted to avoid long term lung damage if I were to get the virus.

(For context) I’m not a strong supporter of vaccines or this one wouldn’t have gotten it if  it wasn’t for asthma 

But anyway I got Pfizer on April 10 at noon the shot was EASY the process was QUICK I was hot after the shot but most likely from anxiety & my outfit. 

Within 2 hrs I was so sleepy I laid down and went to sleep FAST it was all I could do. 

Within 6 my arm was HURTING !! But I was like fine just avoiding moving it
NO OTHER SYMPTOMS. The next day the pain in my arm was gone I never had a fever nothing still now I’ve been GOOD! I’m 24 in good health

Now...like I said I’m not really feeling this situation there’s not enough knowledge of long term effects & ive been seeing women say their periods disappeared after the 2nd shot so at this point I’m thinking about not getting my second one and just not talking about covid again bcuz I just can’t with all this while the revolution is going on

Whatever kills me first at this point I accept ????? (lol for comic relief)

"Covid19 caused my immune system to let HPV develop into warts. I was diagnosed with HPV back in May after discovering lumps around my anus in March. Around that time I went to the hospital for hpv and the warts were slowly growing but it wasn’t much of a concern because I was dealing with one virus. In April after I recovered I went to urgent care in May where I was diagnosed for anal warts. I was given medication to apply on my bum for a month and they shrunk but they reappeared full swing around June. I went to my primary care doctor in July and I told her I discovered the lumps during the time I was sick with Covid19. She informed me that since I had a virus my body wasn’t used to so my immune system went to fight off Covid19 which sent the HPV it was keeping in check to be allowed to take over. So I had to go to my dermatologist and they tried to freeze it off and gave me imiqumod to apply. My dermatologist told me to
apply it 3 times a day and I tried to spread the little amount that was prescribed to me and I ended up getting burns on my bum. It resulted in a week of pain, I couldn’t wash myself properly because the pain was so bad. So I called two pharmacists and even consulted some coworkers (I work in various pharmacies) to know if I’m applying it right. They said applying imiqumod more than 3 times per week will result in irreversible skin damage. Now I have to go back to my primary doctor, get another referral to another dermatologist, restart the imiqumod medication again since I’ve taken a week off from it, and have to get another referral for the colonoscopist to make sure the warts haven’t went inside my bum.

I’m losing hope because I don’t know if I have to stay non sexually active for two years. I wanted to try dating but I don’t want to spread this to anyone. Right now the pain isn’t much since I’m doing it three times per week but I can’t help but think these aren’t going to go away. I have two large warts now and my bum itches time to time."	0
What if I don't get 2nd Vaccine?  I am extremely leery about getting a 2nd dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. I don't even want one dose (because no one knows long term effects of MRNA technology). I heard one dose still provides about 55% immunity. What happens if I don't get the 2nd dose? I really don't think the severe reactions to the 2nd dose seem normal. Most effective vaccines work without triggering such horrible side effects. Since the vaccines are still so new, how do we know the first dose isn't highly effective? It seems that immunity develops slowly.	-1

What is going on with me Firstly, just to clarify, I am not an antivaxxer. I just want to know if this is a normal thing.

I usually only get sick like once a year for me to get sick 3 times in two months is insane.

"Feeling stuck— mRNA vs. J&J? I fully well plan to take the COVID-19 vaccine but I feel conflicted by which “avenue” to go.

Over the pandemic, I’ve developed health anxiety and I’m feeling paralyzed with making a choice.

On a personal note, I feel like a hypocrite because I’ve been singing the praises of a vaccine.

**mRNA**  
On one hand with mRNA, there’s limited safety data and I feel uneasy about the possibility of getting adverse long-term side effects with new tech (like any medication, although I know mRNA technologies have been previously studied). 

**J&J (Janssen)**  
With a viral vector (Janssen), my fears of side effects are quelled with existing tech, but then I worry I won’t feel as “protected” against COVID with a \~66% efficacy. I know 95% vs. 66% is not a perfect apples-to-apples comparison due to how the studies were conducted, either.

Any thoughts or advice on mRNA vs. J&J? I can get appointments for both and initial side effects are not something of concern.

"Sanofi Pasteur - Petition for HSV Hey all, 

Not sure if this belongs here but I just wanted to re-draw everyone's attention to a petition that was created a while back.

Sanofi Pasteur is the largest company in the world devoted entirely to vaccines. From what I have read they have had some setbacks with their COVID vaccines and as we know there are a few other companies that have successfully created COVID vaccines including Moderna, AstraZenica and Pfizer. 

This sub often has posts about HSV (herpes) and is obviously a topic that is often discussed when it comes to STD's due to not having a cure or effective vaccine. I thought, considering the above, it would be a great time to show the likes of Sanofi that there is still a huge demand for their therapeutic vaccine and perhaps they should return to concentrating some of their efforts back to their HSV15 trials and stop any further delays.

"Travel Vaccine Anxiety Hi all- I'm new to this group so I hope this question/concern is on topic for what is usually posted on here. I have a trip planned for South East Asia in January. As expected, there are vaccines that are recommended for my travels.

I have bad anxiety when it comes to vaccines and their potential side effects (tinnitus, neurological problems, etc.) I've concluded that the ones that should be considered are vaccines for rabies, hep B, and Japanese Encephalitis. I understand that the potential benefits outweigh any potential side effects that these shots may come with, but I'm still reluctant to get them due to my fear of the ""what if"". (but I guess that what anxiety is)?

Anyway, if anyone has had a good experience with these shots or have gone threw similar pre travel situations, it would be extremely beneficial and appreciated to hear your thoughts on the matter.

Myself and my never ending racing mind sincerely thank you."	0
"Reminder: The same PSYCHOPATHS pissing in our faces with the Epstein, also want to FORCE INJECT ALL OF US with dangerous, UNTESTED/ UNPROVEN/ UNKNOWN biological material and chemicals. Most people won't even take the time to read what they willingly inject into themselves or their children. I am posting the archive link, since as soon as the shills show up they start tampering with the docs (proof below):

MRC-5... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRC-5
...derived from lung tissue of a 14 week old aborted caucasian male fetus. 

Start asking simple questions... Who are the REAL PEOPLE responsible for vaccine safety? Who is REALLY responsible for vaccine testing and accountability? 

I started with the guy who wrote the excipient table found above: John D Grabenstein 
Who is he, and where has he worked?

Grabenstein went from the Military Vaccine Agency [US Army Medical Command], to now a high up Merck executive. How can he not be in DIRECT CONFLICT OF INTEREST with the CDC?

Can i get vaccinated without my parents consent? i’m confused about it, I (16m) want to get vaccinated but my parents aren’t for it and idk if i can do it without them knowing? any advice or info to give my parents about the vaccine would be much appreciated.	1
Having a colpo at 17w pregnant Like the title implies, I'm having a colposcopy in a few weeks because they found HPV 18 or 45 on my most recent pap smear. Just wondering if anyone else has gone through this while pregnant.... I've had a history of abnormal paps with I think just one maybe two of them coming back as CIN1 and/or LSIL but my pap was all clear last year... I'm just really scared and nervous about having to deal with this on top of being pregnant for the first time. Any advice much appreciated.	0
"I got the quadrivalent flu vaccine for over 65, but I'm 33. Is this ok? Hello! 

Three days ago, I received the flu vaccine. Since the day after, I've been experiencing fatigue and chills, which didn’t happen last year. I have a chronic condition called functional dyspepsia, which makes it difficult for me to eat normal foods like vegetables and fruits, and as a result, I'm underweight. I'm 33 years old, and I'm unsure if my immune system is compromised due to this condition. However, I believe the flu vaccine is harmless, so I decided to get it anyway. 

What do you think? Will I be fine?"	0
"Pro Vaccin Manifesto I know there’s still a lot of misinformation about how vaccines work, propagated by people who regurgitate garbage they read on an article on the internet. I wanted to share this manifesto that encompasses why vaccines are a GOOD thing and why you NEED to vaccinate you and your children. There is no excuse.

**Pro Vax Manifesto**


* All disease is bad.

* All vaccines are good.

* The science is settled, all vaccines work.

* All vaccines are equally effective.

* All vaccines are equally safe.


* Vaccines are tested for safety more than any other pharmaceutical product.

* Vaccine safety studies are long term studies, meaning they last for more than four days.

* Experimental vaccines intended for babies are first tested on babies.

* Experimental vaccines that will eventually be given to unhealthy children are first tested on unhealthy children.

* Vaccine safety studies always include inert placebos.

* The entire vaccine schedule has been studied for safety.


* The theory and the practice of vaccination are identical.

* Vaccine Information Sheets contain the same information as Vaccine Package Inserts.

* Vaccination equals immunization yet the public should still fear and ostracize the unvaccinated.

* Vaccines work, but only if everyone else is vaccinated because, of course, my medicine makes your medicine more effective.

* Everyone should be forced to vaccinate to protect the vaccinated from getting the diseases for which they were vaccinated.


* Vaccines have never caused ADHD, tics, Guillain-Barré Syndrome, learning disabilities, cancer, diabetes, eczema, paralysis, autism, or any other injury.

* It’s just a coincidence when babies get sick, diseased, regress, or die following vaccination.

* Vaccination is the leading cause of coincidences.


* There is nothing in vaccines that could hurt a baby or anyone else. That’s why vaccine manufacturers and doctors can’t be sued for vaccine injury.

* If vaccines injure a baby, it’s the baby’s fault for having bad genes. Vaccines just identify the defect.

* Vaccines are composed of neurotoxins, human fetal tissue, animal tissue, adjuvants, allergens, antigens, and contaminants. Buildings are evacuated and hazmat teams are called when the contents of a vaccine spill on the floor. That’s why the same ingredients are safe when repeatedly injected into pregnant women, infants, toddlers, teens, the aged, and virtually everyone in between.

* The toxic ingredients in vaccines make sick people healthy and healthy people healthier.


* Injecting toxins is no different than ingesting toxins.

* Because one vaccine is safe, two, four, eight vaccines etc. are equally safe.

* Vaccines are better than vitamins, the more you get, the healthier you are.

* All babies can safely receive thousands of vaccines at once.


* High-pitched screams, fevers, lethargy, being zoned out, sleeping for days, diarrhea, and seizures are normal vaccine reactions.

* Normal reactions are not vaccine injury.


* The US vaccine schedule is the only schedule in the world.

* There are no alternative schedules.

* Alternative schedules are untested and dangerous.


* Until recently, 100% of people failed to notice behaviors and traits associated with autism that have always existed in 2% of the population. Some of these behaviors and traits include head banging, spinning, hand flapping, poop smearing, delayed speech, speech regression, inability to speak, speaking in an abnormal tone of voice, repeating words and phrases over and over again, yelling, crying, or laughing for no apparent reason, obsessive attachment to unusual objects, gastrointestinal problems, explosive diarrhea, extreme sensitivity to light, sound and touch, indifference to temperature or pain, difficulty understanding other people’s feelings, reactions, or facial expressions, resistance to being touched, failure to bond or emotionally connect with parents, siblings, and others, wandering, and lack of fear of water sometimes resulting in drowning.

* Autism is normal.

* Autism is a gift.

* Autism should be celebrated.

* Parents who don’t celebrate their kids’ autism are selfish crybabies.

* Autism is an evolutionary response to the computer age.

* No vaccine has ever caused autism.

* Only one now debunked paper written solely by one now disgraced doctor has ever linked vaccines to autism.

* That man is a fraud and he’s personally responsible for killing millions of babies just like Hitler.


* Media outlets can be trusted because they always report the truth about vaccines.

* Media outlets are not influenced by corporate sponsors or government censorship.

* Media should shame and mock parents of vaccine-injured children, especially the moms.

* Media should libel and misquote doctors and scientists who address vaccine safety issues.

* Media should not give fair and equal airtime to parents of vaccine-injured children.

* Media sponsored hate speech is bad … unless it’s directed at parents of vaccine-injured children.

* Media should slam movies such as Vaxxed without ever watching them.


* The pharmaceutical industry does not influence medical school curriculum.

* Doctors are taught everything there is to know about vaccination:


1. disease is bad

2. vaccines are good

3. vaccine administration and

4. strategies to coerce vaccine hesitant parents and others to vaccinate.

* Listen to your doctor … unless your doctor warns you about the dangers of vaccination.

* The ethical principle of informed consent which was established after World War II to prevent further medical experimentation on uninformed and unwilling subjects does not apply to vaccination.

* When doctors coerce and threaten parents to vaccinate their kids, they are not violating medical ethics.

* Medical providers should manifesto adverse events from medications, but they should deny vaccine-induced adverse events because vaccines are safe and effective.

* Doctors who address vaccine safety concerns should lose their medical licenses.


* The HPV vaccine has been proven to prevent cancer.

* Teen aged girls who fake injury—including paralysis, full body tics, and debilitating pain resulting in being confined to their homes and beds—after getting the HPV vaccine should see a shrink for psychological problems.

* Exposure to chickenpox and measles in childhood provides no health benefits later in life.

* Getting chickenpox is very bad and very scary.

* Getting measles is very, very bad and very, very scary because measles is one of the most lethal diseases on Earth and probably in the whole universe. That’s why parents used to take their kids to measles and chickenpox parties.


* Vaccines don’t contain human fetal tissue.

* Only two babies have been aborted for vaccine research.


* Vaccines used to contain mercury, but that doesn’t matter because it was the good kind.

* Vaccines don’t contain mercury anymore, but that doesn’t matter because it was the good kind.

* Vaccines now banned in developed countries because they contained mercury are still being used in developing countries, but that doesn’t matter because it’s the good kind.

* The amount of mercury in some “preservative- or thimerosal-free” vaccines exceed the EPA-mandated Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) and must be disposed of as hazardous waste. But that doesn’t matter, because it’s the good kind of hazardous waste.


* Aluminum is a known neurotoxin and is proven to play a significant role in promoting neurological diseases like Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, dementia, and autism. That’s why it’s safe to inject newborns with aluminum in excess of EPA safety limits.

* Aluminum is essential for optimal brain functioning and development.


* There is no valid reason for religious people to object to vaccination because God has no problem with injecting healthy babies time and time again with a variety of cell-killing and brain-damaging concoctions.


* People get Hepatitis B from dirty needles and sexual activity. That’s why Hep B negative mothers should consent to have their 1 day old infants injected with the Hep B vaccine.


* Pus from cowpox eradicated smallpox.

* 10% of the Earth’s population received smallpox vaccines. That’s why nearly everyone needs to be vaccinated to eradicate a disease.

* Not getting the chickenpox vaccine will kill millions of people from smallpox.

* Not getting the measles vaccine will put millions of kids in iron lungs.

* The polio vaccine used in India is not causing paralysis in 30,000 children per year.


* Sanitation, clean drinking water, and good food are responsible for the reduction of diseases for which there are currently no vaccines. However, once a vaccine is developed for any of those diseases, the previous statement will no longer be valid.?

* Immunocompromised people should not be vaccinated with live virus vaccines … unless they live in developing countries.

* The oral polio vaccine should never be given to HIV positive people … unless they live in Africa.

* Being sick is no reason not to get vaccinated.


* It would be impossible to conduct a vaxxed vs. unvaxxed study because all the unvaxxed kids have already died from vaccine preventable diseases.

* It would be unethical to conduct a vaxxed vs. unvaxxed study because withholding vaccines from children would kill them.


* Vaccines have never been tested for safety with pregnant women and their fetuses. That’s why it’s safe to inject them in pregnant women.

* Pregnant women should avoid alcohol, antibiotics, Thalidomide, and other pharmaceutical products, but should receive all vaccines offered them at any stage of their pregnancies.

* Babies are born vaccine deficient.

* Premature infants need the protection from vaccines even more than full term infants.

* Even though the pertussis vaccine does not prevent the transmission of pertussis and is known to result in asymptomatic carriers of the virus, vaccinating family members is the best way to protect newborns from whooping cough.


*Drug companies make drugs for profit, but they make vaccines out of the goodness of their hearts.

* Anti-vaxxers enrich themselves writing and selling anti-vaccine propaganda.


* The industry has never lied about vaccine safety, efficacy, or necessity.

* The industry has never faked vaccine research.

* The industry would never divide vaccine lots to spread out and hide vaccine injury and death.

* The industry would never test vaccines on orphans, disabled people, or people of color.

* Merck lied about Vioxx, but it would never lie about its vaccines.

* Merck supervisors did not order its scientists to fake the efficacy of the mumps vaccine.


* The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation didn’t get booted out of India for conducting cloaked vaccine trials on Indian girls resulting in thousands of injuries and hundreds of deaths.

* The Gates Foundation isn’t preparing to vaccinate hundreds of thousands of African babies with an experimental malaria vaccine known to have negative efficacy, meaning that vaccinated babies get malaria at a higher rate than vaccine free babies.


* The CDC can be trusted.

* The CDC’s primary interest is the health and safety of American children.

* The CDC does not own over 50 vaccine patents and does not profit from vaccine sales.

* CDC employees have no conflicts of interest.

* When the CDC reports that the flu vaccine is 40% effective, that means that the vaccine prevents the flu in four out of ten people.

* CDC employees have never consorted with industry or the medical establishment to hide the relationship between mercury-containing Thimerosal and autism.

* CDC employees have never consorted with industry or the medical establishment to hide the relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism.

* CDC employees have never trashed data linking the MMR vaccine to autism.

* There is no CDC whistleblower.


* There is no such thing as a Vaccine Court because there’s no such thing as vaccine injury.

* The Vaccine Court has not paid out more than $3.5 billion for vaccine injury and death.


* Congress is not influenced by donations from Big Pharma.

* Congress has never ignored vaccine safety issues.

* Congress has never been complicit in hiding vaccine safety issues from the public.


* Scientific journals can be trusted.

* The papers in scientific journals can be trusted.

* The drug industry does not ghostwrite pro-vax papers for scientists to sign.

* Scientists who address vaccine safety issues should be censured or fired.


* The anti-vax movement is a recent phenomenon.

* Anti-vaxxers get their information from a Playboy bunny.

* Anti-vaxxers get their information from the Internet and everybody knows you can’t trust anything on the Internet, except for the CDC, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the pharmaceutical industry.

* The AAP has no conflicts of interest with the pharmaceutical industry.


* All unvaccinated people are dangerous vectors of disease.

* All vaccinated kids with HIV, Hep B, chicken pox, measles, influenza, whooping cough, etc., should be allowed in school.

* All children recently vaccinated with live virus vaccines should be allowed in school.

* All unvaxxed kids are by definition sick and dangerous disease vectors.

* All unvaxxed kids should be banned from school, because they’re especially dangerous on weekdays from 8 am to 3 pm.

* All anti-vaxxers are anti-science.

* All anti-vaxxers are baby killers.

* All anti-vaxxers should lose custody of their children.

* All anti-vaxxers should be quarantined, jailed, or hung.

* When someone dies of a disease, unvaccinated people should be charged, tried, and convicted of murder.


* Pro-vaxxers are logical, pro-science, and open-minded.

* Pro-vaxxers tolerate differing points of view and are all around caring, compassionate people.

"Welcome to /r/HPV - A safe place to go when times are hard Quote from /r/STD - it applies to /r/HPV either:

> The sub is intended to help calm the anxiety that comes with a potential STD infection through education, awareness, and prevention techniques. If you have concerns about your health, please seek a health care provider to address the concerns you have. No subreddit's contents can replace actual medical care from a physician.

**1. INTRODUCTION**

As CDC says:

> HPV infections are so common that nearly all men and women will get at least one type of HPV at some point in their lives. Most people never know that they have been infected and may give HPV to a sex partner without knowing it. Nearly 80 million Americans are currently infected with some type of HPV. About 14 million people in the United States become newly infected each year.

> Most people with HPV never develop symptoms or health problems. Most HPV infections (9 out of 10) go away by themselves within two years. But, sometimes, HPV infections will last longer, and can cause certain cancers and other diseases. HPV infections can cause:

> * cancers of the cervix, vagina, and vulva in women;

> * cancers of the penis in men; and

> * cancers of the anus and back of the throat, including the base of the tongue and tonsils (oropharynx), in both women and men.

> * warts and genital warts

> Most HPV infections are transient and asymptomatic, causing no symptoms. More than 90% of new HPV infections, including those caused by high-risk HPV types, clear or become undetectable within 2 years, and clearance usually occurs in the first 6 months after infection.

As dr Handsfield wrote:

> Probably 25-30% of all sexually active men in North America or Europe are diagnosed at one time or another with genital warts. (...) Going further, at least 90% get HPV at least once, and at any point in time at least 50% of all men and women in their 20s and 30s have active HPV infections.

**IMPORTANT message for MSM:** please vaccinate yourself as soon as possible:

> Participant mean age was 25 years (range = 18–40), with 48.9% self-identifying as gay and 86.5% reporting having sex exclusively with men. At baseline, 530 participants had HPV DNA present (61.1% with high-risk HPV, 84.9% with low-risk HPV)

**2. HOW TO KEEP MENTAL HEALTH DURING HPV INFECTION?**

* Remember that you are not alone.

> HPV infections are so common that nearly all men and women will get at least one type of HPV at some point in their lives. Most people never know that they have been infected and may give HPV to a sex partner without knowing it. Nearly 80 million Americans are currently infected with some type of HPV. About 14 million people in the United States become newly infected each year. [source](https://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/stdfact-hpv.htm)

* You are not dirty or worse than other people. Other people just don't know bout their active or previous infections.

* Calm down. Don't stress yourself. Be patient.

> ""Women who reported self-destructive coping strategies, like drinking, smoking cigarettes or taking drugs when stressed, were more likely to develop an active HPV infection,"" said principal investigator Anna-Barbara Moscicki, MD, FAAP, chief of the Division of Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine and professor of pediatrics at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Medicine. ""We also found that women who were depressed or perceived themselves to have lots of stress were more likely to have HPV persistence,"" she said, adding that this study is the first to show these connections between stress and HPV persistence. [source](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160430100243.htm)

* See this video about HPV infections: https://youtu.be/KOz-bNhEHhQ

* Stop reading random pages and sources about HPV. There is lots of misinformation and scary stories. 

* Stick to reliable websites, for example: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt05-hpv.html) or [McGill](https://www.mcgill.ca/traphpv/hpvfacts).

* I will repeat once again: read CDC's and McGill's websites.

* Remember that 64% infections clear within 6 months, 80% within 12 months. 

> When researchers looked at the 10 most prevalent types of HPV, they noted 36% of prevalent infections persisted after six months, 20% persisted to 12 months, 13% persisted to 18 months and 9% persisted to 24 months (95% CI for all). [source](
https://www.healio.com/infectious-disease/stds/news/print/infectious-disease-news/%7Baf692634-fd8f-4598-926d-1847b0ea5e5f%7D/many-hpv-infections-may-clear-quickly-without-treatment)

* Remember that HPV is not for life.

> Most HPV infections in young men and women are transient, lasting no more than one or two years. Usually, the body clears the infection on its own. It is estimated that the infection will persist in only about 1% of women. It is those infections that persist which may lead to cancer. There is some research that suggests that the virus can hide deep in the affected mucosa or skin for several years, below detectable levels. These are called “latent” infections. Having an HPV-positive test followed by an HPV-negative test might mean two different things: that the virus has been completely cleared by the body, or that the level of infection is so small that laboratory tests cannot detect it. Thus, HPV might “reappear” several years after an infection (whether or not it was treated) when the immune system weakens (because of aging, pregnancy, illness, etc.) and then cause lesions. It is unknown what proportion of HPV infections go latent, nor what proportions are truly cleared by the body.

https://mcgill.ca/traphpv/hpvfacts

* If you have CIN then calm down too:

>HPV infection is necessary but not sufficient to develop CIN. More than 90% of infections are spontaneously cleared by the immune system within one year without treatment. Approximately 60% of CIN 1 lesions regress without treatment and less than 1% progress to cancer. However, it is estimated that 5% of CIN 2 and 12% of CIN 3 cases will progress to invasive cancer if untreated. In general, it takes 10 to 20 years for CIN to progress to cancer, allowing a significant time period for detection and treatment. Progression from CIN to cancer requires persistent HPV infection.

> Co-factors associated with persistent HPV infection and progression of disease include smoking, HIV infection, and other types of immunosuppression.

[source](https://www.cancertherapyadvisor.com/home/decision-support-in-medicine/obstetrics-and-gynecology/cervical-pre-invasive-diagnosis-and-treatment/)

* Start eating healthy food.  

>  Previous studies have reported that women with lower intakes of vegetables and fruits as well as vitamins A, C, and E have a higher risk of high grade CIN and CC [9,12]. Accordingly, our study highlighted the protective role of the prudent dietary pattern, a Mediterranean-like diet pattern, which was negatively associated with the risk of CIN2+. Particularly, CIN2+ risk was lower among women with medium–high adherence, compared to those with low adherence to the prudent pattern. [source](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/4/469/htm)

> People who eat fruits and vegetables, which happen to be good sources of antioxidants and other phytochemicals, have a lower risk of heart disease and some neurological diseases, and there is evidence that some types of vegetables and fruits in general, protect against a number of cancers as epidemiological studies revealed, without providing the answer whether any specific bioactive molecules within fruit and vegetable have a special contribution on lower incidence. However, 80% of American children and adolescents and 68% of adults do not eat five portions a day. Inadequate dietary intakes of vitamins and minerals are widespread, most likely due to excessive consumption of energy-rich, micronutrient-poor, and refined food. [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3236599/)

* You can check [Sten Ekberg's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/drekberg) about keto and low-carb diet.

* Don't smoke, don't drink too much, don't do drugs.

> Multiple studies have found both smoking and alcohol use to be significant risk factors of persistent oral and genital HPV infection. It has been proposed that the carcinogens in cigarette smoke increase viral load as well as the likelihood of cancerous transformation of the epithelial cells infected with HPV. [source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319480835_Targeting_Persistent_Human_Papillomavirus_Infection)

* You don't need to take any supplements to clear infection, however many people like to ""do something"", just to feel better. If you have low risk HPV infection you can think about i.e. combined therapy with Inosine Pranobex or oral Zinc. If you have high risk HPV infection you can think about i.e. Inosine Pranobex or medicinal mushrooms. 

See [this post about food supplements and immunostimulants](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/d6qkh6/medicinal_mushrooms_immunostimulants_dietary/) and this [Table of Evidence about alternative treatments](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/f644ko/table_of_evidence_alternative_treatments_against/).

* but remember: usually the healthy lifestyle is enough to clear HPV infection.

* Daily exercise is a good idea. Check Team Body Project channel on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFjc9H89-RpWuIStDqhO7AQ). Personally I don't like exercises, but I started 2 months ago with this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC_L9qAHVJ8

* If you think too much about HPV then focus on something else, do something. Read books? Travel? Watch Netflix? HBO? Cook? Exercise? Play on PlayStation 4? Xbox One? [Listen to The Good Life Radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIWVfkF2IeI)?

* Read what different doctors say about HPV infections: 

> “HPV is extraordinarily common and is the most common sexually transmitted disease. Almost every sexually active person gets exposed to at least one, if not several, of the 15 carcinogenic viruses,” said Mark Schiffman, MD, head of the HPV unit at the Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics at the National Cancer Institute (NCI).

> “If you’ve got HIV, you’ve got HIV, but if you’ve got HPV, you’re about to not have HPV,” Schiffman said. “Nine out of 10 times you don’t have it in two years. Maybe your body suppresses it like chickenpox, maybe it is completely gone, but the result is that you are OK.”

> “If you look at the curve, what it shows is that if you wait six months, you’ve gotten rid of half your worry,” Schiffman said.

https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/9k1yr0/hpv_disclosure_open_discussion/

* Many people cleared HPV infections. Read their stories: https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/9pu4du/your_experiences_with_low_risk_high_risk_hpv/

* After HPV clearance it's possible to get reinfected with the same strain so if you can then get the vaccine (Gardasil or Gardasil 9)

**3. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (F.A.Q)**

**Q: I have a que...**

Before asking any questions download and read the CDC's guideline:

* https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/31403

**Q: Can I upload my photos to /r/HPV?**

No, you can't. There are special subreddits such as /r/IsThisHPV /r/genitalwarts /r/Warts where you can upload your photos. Besides of that only a real doctor can diagnose you. Some people think that Fordyce spots, Vestibular papillomatosis, Pearly penile papules or Molluscum are warts.

**Q: I'm a virgin. Can I have genital warts?**

Very unlikely. You can search Google for keywords:

* Fordyce spots

* Seborrheic keratosis

* Pearly penile papules

**Q: How to deal with stress?**

Check this NHS website:

* [Things you can try to help with stress](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/understanding-stress/)

**Q: Does HPV infection mean infidelity?**

> HPV is often shared between partners and can lie dormant for many years; having HPV does not imply infidelity, nor should it necessarily raise concerns about a partner’s health.

https://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/hpv-cancer.htm

**Q: Does removing genital warts remove the infection?**

No (that's why recurrence rates are high).

**Q: Will I have genital warts forever?**

Only ~1% people with low risk HPV have recurrent genital warts. 

**Q: What are genital warts transmission rates?**

> Genital warts are very contagious, with an estimated rate of infection between 60 and 75 percent from unprotected exposure (NIAID, 2004; Soper, 2002). The incubation period for genital warts is usually between three weeks and six months, but it may last for years after exposure (ASHA, 1998; ASHA, 2006).

[source](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/8913/9611/8041/HPV.pdf)

**Q: Will I have oral warts?**

Around 0.5% people have oral warts and 5% people with HIV, so there is no need to panic about oral warts. If you want to get a proper diagnosis then see ENT (Ear Neck Throat) doctor.

> Oral warts are usually asymptomatic, may be persistent or uncommonly, may regress spontaneously. HPV-associated oral warts have a prevalence of 0.5% in the general population, occur in up to 5% of HIV-seropositive subjects, and in up to 23% of HIV-seropositive subjects on highly active antiretroviral therapy.

**Q: How long does Gardasil work?**

At least 12 years:

> Vaccine effectiveness of 100% (95% CI 94·7–100) was demonstrated for ?12 years, with a trend toward continued protection through 14 years post-vaccination. Seropositivity rates at study conclusion were >90% (HPV6/11/16) and 52% (HPV18) using competitive Luminex immunoassay, and >90% (all four HPV types) using the more sensitive IgG Luminex immunoassay.

**How about HPV and relationships?**

Here is dr Handsfield's opinion: answer to the question #4882

> Over time, almost all HPV infections are suppressed or entirely eradicated by the immune system.

> Our usual advice about genital warts is that people should either abstain with new partners, or advise potential partners of their infection, for 3-6 months after treatment, then not necessary if no recurrence of the wart. These are not science-based guidelines, just a common sense approach of many STD experts.

> But none of this applies to current, ongoing partner(s). You can safely assume regular partners have already been repeatedly exposed, and no need or benefit to stopping contact now. That horse is long out of the barn, no use in closing the door now.

**Q: Is HPV for life?**

Comment from /r/Virology /u/CJay07

> I studied HPV for my PhD work, and the statement that ""HPV is with you for life"" isn't accurate. Most sexually active individuals are infected with HPV at one point during their lifetime. Epidemiological estimates range from 60-80% by the time you reach your forties. However, most infections are cleared by the immune system within a few months. A small subset of those individuals that do not clear the virus maintain a persistent infection (~1-2 years), but even those infections get cleared. An even smaller set of people go on to cancer. By that time however, the virus is generally long gone. One common situation in HPV-associated cancer is where the viral genome accidentally becomes a part of the host chromosome and the oncogenic (tumor promoting) elements of the virus become constitutively expressed. Those elements lead to rapid cell growth, among other things. Despite a little bit of the viral genome present at this stage, no viral particles can (or will be) produced.

> HPV infects basal epithelial stem cells, which are self renewing and give rise to the rest of the skin architecture. Here, the virus is maintained as an episome (viral DNA tethered to the host chromosome). There are no in tact virus particles here. Just viral DNA. It takes about three weeks for daughter cells (cells produced from the epithelial stem cells) to reach the surface, and it is not until during the final stages of cellular differentiation (cells becoming keratinized, stratifying, forming the uppermost layers of the skin) that you actually get the production of infectious virus particles. The virus coat (capsid), which envelops and protects the viral DNA, is produced very late during skin differentiation. This is a very fancy mechanism for immune evasion if you think about it. The superficial layers of the skin are not routinely surveyed by the immune system (because these cells are going to die), so by the time HPV expresses its most immunogenic products (the capsid proteins), immune cells are rarely to be found. This is one thought for how HPV can persist for so long (months to years), although the virus has many other ""tricks"" up its sleeve to hide from the immune system. With all that being said, when I say ""virus is cleared"", I mean the viral DNA is gone from its reservoir cell (the epithelial stem cell). Once that is gone, you don't have new viral particles being produced, and those particles that are hanging out on/in the skin will be lost during the natural turnover of the skin. This process wouldn't take long. It's more on the order of weeks, rather than years.

**Q: How many people have latent infections?**

In case of women (results from 15 years):

> Most CIN3+ cases (76%) were diagnosed in women who were positive at baseline (the first known positive HPV result); 16% were attributed to apparent newly detected infections and **3% to possible reappearing infections.**

**Q: Why HPV clearance takes so much time?**

> The host’s immune response to HPV infection (humoral immunity, mainly IgG) is usually slow, weak, wane over time, and varied considerably with many women not seroconverting. Generally, close to half of the individuals seroconvert to L1 protein of HPV 16, 18, or 6 within 18 months. Other HPV antigens [E1, E2, E6, and L2] do not evoke any antibody responses in patients with acute or persistent HPV infection. Natural infection-elicited antibodies may not provide complete protection to HPV over time. A recent WHO position paper stated that host antibodies, mostly directed against the viral L1 protein, do not necessarily protect against subsequent infection by the same HPV genotype.

**Read these links before asking questions about oral HPV.**

**Q: What are the first-line treatments against genital warts?**

You can try Cryotherapy, Imiquimod / Aldara, Podophyllotoxin, Veregen, Laser surgery. Don't use Podophyllin. The problem with all treatments is that there are high recurrence rates. Removing GWs doesn't mean HPV clearance. It's just removing symptoms.

**Q: How about urethral warts?**

You can ask your doctor about Laser surgery, electrocauterization (painful), [ingenol mebutate](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956462418824453) (expensive) or [photodynamic therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2133.2004.06189.x).

**Q: I'm gay. What doctor should I see?**

* Urologist/dermatologist for external genital warts.

* Proctologist for internal genital warts.

* Remember about vaccination and regular anal pap smears.

**Q: What are the first-line treatments against nongenital warts?**

Salicylic acid and Cryotherapy. Check this article:

**Q: How to use Podophyllotoxin? How to use Imiquimod? How to use...?**

* Always read leaflets

* Always check possible side-effects

* Some supplements (i.e. Zinc) can cause side-effects, so consult usage of them with your doctor

* Follow your doctor's instructions (unless they are not correct i.e. contradicts informations from the leaflets)

Read this PDF:

* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1744412/pdf/v077p00409.pdf

**Q: Which treatments should I use?**

Ask your doctor/s. They finished medical schools and get money from you. Let them do their job. If your doctor is ignorant then find a better one.

**Q: Can I use OTC freeze kits against GWs?**

No. Avoid ignorant and dangerous ideas from some random people/websites. Dr School's clearly states:

>Do not use on areas with thin skin such as the face, armpits, breasts, bottom, or genitals. Use on these areas may cause burns and permanent scarring.

> Do not use on moles, birthmarks, warts with hair growing from them, genital (on penis or vaginal areas) warts, or on warts on the face or mucous membranes (such as inside mouth, nose, anus, genitals, lips, ears or near eyes). It may cause burns and permanent scarring of skin or blindness.

**Q: My doctor gave me Podophyllotoxin... My doctor gave me Imiquimod / Aldara… can I use it more often? I'm really desperated.**

No. Don't do it. You will get serious side-effects. Stick to the instructions from your doctor and from the leaflets. One time I used Podophyllotoxin for 3.5 days (it should be used for 3 days) and it created small wounds in my genital area. It wasn't a nice experience.

**Q: Can I combine Cryotherapy and Podophyllotoxin?**

See [this clinical study](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/abba/2343b4c6058caa29843c45d3e0c5e63dc8c7.pdf) and ask your doctor.

**Q: What is the cheapest/easiest way to lower chances for GW recurrences?**

Propably it's genital warts removal combined with oral Zinc or Zinc Sulphate. Unfortunately Zinc can cause side-effects in some people. Always read the original clinical studies to know all details (i.e. about dosage).

**Q: Are there any new therapies against genital warts?**

There is ISDIN Verrutop, which can be used against nongenital and genital warts. It's made in Spain but can be ordered from online shop in Portugal. ISDIN Verrutop should be applied by health professionals. Check its leaflet: [LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/eg5aex/isdin_verrutop_nitrizinc_complex_the_text_from/).

**Q: Is it safe to get pregnant soon after LEEP procedure?**

It will be better if you will wait at least 12 months.

> Five hundred ninety-six patients met inclusion criteria. Median time from LEEP to pregnancy was significantly shorter for women with an spontaneous abortion (20 months, interquartile range 11.2–40.9 vs. 31 months, interquartile range 18.7–51.2, p-value 0.01), but did not differ for women with a term birth compared to preterm birth. Women with a time interval shorter than 12 months compared to 12 months or more had a significantly increased risk for spontaneous abortion (17.9% vs. 4.6%, aOR 5.6, 95%CI 2.5–12.7).

There is photodynamic therapy (effective against genital warts and CIN)

> By 1 week after the last treatment, the complete clearance rate was 95.93% in the ALA?PDT group and 100% in CO2 laser group (P>0.05). The clearance rate of CA at male urethral orifice was100% in the ALA?PDT group and 100% in the CO2 laser group (P>0.05). The overall recurrence rate calculated by the end of the entire follow?up period was significantly lower in the ALA?PDT group than that in the CO2 laser group (9.38% vs 17.39%, P<0.05).

Unfortunately both therapies are not available for the most people. 

**Q: What are the recurrence rates for genital warts?**

You can find the answer for this question (and other basic questions) in [CDC manual](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt05-hpv.html).

> Recurrence of anogenital warts within 3 months is common (approximately 30%), whether clearance occurs spontaneously or following treatment.

**Q: I have strong genital warts outbreaks. Why?**

There are many possibilities, for example:

* HIV

* immunodeficiency

* uncontrolled diabetes

**Q: I have Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis. Is there any hope for me?**

Please check clinical studies about RRP and Gardasil. You can also check the studies about MVA E2 therapeutic vaccine.

**Q: I don't have a health insurance. Can I use Apple Cider Vinegar? ACV?**

ACV can cause chemical burns, scars or make your skin thicker. It's always better to see a doctor than try not reliable ""home remedies"". If you live in the USA then Planned Parenthood clinics should be affordable.

**Q: Where can I find the informations about different HPV strains? Is there any list of different strains?**

Check this PDF file:

* https://monographs.iarc.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mono90.pdf

**Q: Are there any therapeutic vaccines?**

There aren't any comercially available therapeutic vaccines, however there are some vaccines that showed efficiency in clinical studies:

* MVA E2, intralesional, very effective, tested in Mexico. It's intralesional, so can be used against GWs, CIN and RRP.

* VGX-3100, less effective, but there is a big corporation (Inovio) behind it. It can be used against high risk HPV.

* INO-3107, another vaccine created by Inovio. Actually it's being tested against Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (HPV 6 and HPV 11).

* BLS-M07, oral vaccine actually being tested in South Korea. It can be used against high risk HPV.

There are many ongoing clinical trials:

* https://www.dovepress.com/therapeutic-vaccines-for-hpv-associated-malignancies-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-ITT

Besides of that some scientists / dermatologists use:

* Intralesional MMR vaccine (off-label usage) against genital and nongenital warts.

* Intralesional Candida antigen (off-label usage) against nongenital warts.

* Intralesional BCG vaccine (off-label usage) against nongenital warts.

"Recurrent Lesion trying to concieve First of all I want to thank you all for sharing your experiences, reading through this forum has helped me a lot not to feel alone in this struggle. So here it is my experience, I was diagnosed with LSIL two years ago, I was advice to watch and wait but I after about 8 months of persistance I decided to have the lesion removed with a laser because I wanted to get pregnant sooner than latter (I am 36 now). After a couple of follow up check ups everything looked ok but during the last one, 1 year and a half after the procedure another lesion showed up in my colposcopy. 

This was a couple of days ago and I have been feelling terrible as I was certain all of this was behind and was ready to start trying to conceive. I still have to wait for the pap results but my doctor says she would advice me to get pregnant and treat after because of time concerns. Honestly I don't the stress would allow me to do this, additionally I havent had a biopsy this time and I am not sure if the lesion is low grade again.

My mind is racing and I cant stop thinking that the lesion wasn't removed correctly and that I have a very agressive form of HPV as it hasn't cleared in more than two years as they always say it should. Has anyone been through the same? What did you do? and are we damned to live with this forever? I am just very sad right now. Thanks for reading.

"1 year follow up today Hi all

I promised i would be back with an update.

Ive lurked on here for 12 months. Stressed constantly. 

Anyways, i found out i had high risk hpv last year. I had my recheck last week and got my results today.

Normal pap and no hpv!! Hpv aptima test NEGATIVE!

I AM CRYING HAPPY TEARS. I WILL POST MORE LATER OF WHAT I DID. ??????"	1
Hpv???? Hi all! I was told in 2016 I had hpv when I had an abnormal pap. I was told my system would clear it. I had a baby in 2018 and had another pap after it was normal. 2021 I have another baby and had another pap, this time abnormal. I have colposcopy and then get cryo for cell changes. Pap after this is normal. I had another pap in 2023 which was normal with negative hpv test. I thought this was done. I just had another pap recently and tested positive for hpv again. How is this possible? My husband does not have any warts or anything. We’ve been together for 10+ years so  not having sex with anyone else. I’ve read young healthy people should clear it and it only comes back if you have an immune deficiency, which I don’t think I have. Is this normal? Thanks	0
"Spotting out of nowhere 39F here! Had 2 leeps last year (June and Sep 2022). First leep cin 3 and 1 mm of micro invasive squamous cell carcinoma) the margins of that leep came just focally involved with CIN. Carcinoma completely removed 


Second leep Sept 22’, came totally fine.

"I GOT RID OF HPV-18 & HPV-16!! Ok this is the story of a long journey (1 year) of me doing everything in my power to get rid of HPV. 
Started one year ago, I got an abnormal pap smear test which was CIN1 and positive for HPV-18. First things first, after crying for 2 days, I changed my horrible gyno because her approach was not helping. I chose someone that was specified for HPV and did my colposcopy with him. We decided together that even tho it was just CIN1, because it was spread a lot in my cervix, it was a good call to do LEEP. I did it and my margins were clear (everything about LEEP and colposcopy is in my previous post). 

Then 6 months later I went to get tested to another clinic due to being somewhere else. The pap smear was clear but then my HPV test showed HPV-16 this time. Although I must say, I do not trust this clinic but I was shocked because I didn’t change partners or anything else. It could have been dormant I guess or wrong test but who knows. 

3 months later I went to see my own doctor and did colposcopy and biopsy. It showed a very small area of CIN1. We didn’t do anything about it. 

And today, 1 year and 2 months later, I got the test results and NEGATIVE for HPV and clean pap smear test. This is one of the happiest days of my life.
Here’s what I did. 

I took full control and did a lot of research. 
I started a vaginal gel designed for abnormal cervical lesion. I used it for 1 month but it is recommended for 3 months. The name is Deflagyn. 

Ingredients: High dispersion silicon dioxide (10 mg), citric acid (24.8 mg), sodium selenium (0.83 mg), selenium equivalent (0.25 mg)

I have been taking a lot of vitamins for a year and they are:
Folic Acid, Multivitamins for women high in vitamin B, Beta-Glucans, Turkey Tail Mushroom, Vitamin C (time to time), Iron (time to time, I’m low on iron usually), Selenium (one month on one month off), D3 + K2 drops, AHCC for 2 months then stopped, Omega-3 (time to time), a pill designed for HPV it has Green Tea Extract, Licorice Extract, Cinnamon Extract and Selenium (used it for 1 month in total), Vitamin B12 chewable tablets for 15 days, probiotics. 

I read a research about Calcium and HPV and started calcium for 2 months. I cant find the paper but will post if I do. 

During the first couple of months, I also did a cure of Inosine Pranobex. The research on the positive effects is here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8180272/

I was less stressed during this period but I have a bit of anxiety and I didn’t do a lot to control it. 

This is a bit extra but I went to a detox camp (that I went before) where for 3 days I did juicing and 4 days, green salad and juicing. During this time, I did colon cleanse (you can research it). I think this really boosted my gut health. It is possible to do all the juicing and detox at home, just got to be devoted and it helps to get rid of toxins so you nature help your body to fight whatever is really needed to be fought. 

And my diet, which I think is the most important thing changed. I stopped starving myself. I used to have an eating disorder and did my best to avoid that. 
First of all, I started eating much more but always healthier. Although I must say, I ate more meat than I ever do (but still very little, 1 time a week). 

My fiber intake was the goal, I started eating Psyllium Husk, ate A LOT of kale, a lot of greens, A LOT of fruit. I aimed for 30 gr fiber a day. 

I drank a lot of water, less alcohol, a lot of kombucha. I smoked weed time to time but VERY little, I was in Thailand so it was clean weed bought from a store idk if it matters. I smoke normal cigarettes but only 2-3 a week. 

I exercise regularly but during the summer due to work I lost a lot of weight and winter time I got back to my normal healthier weight but still exercised regularly. But I do not force my body, I did body weight workouts and a lot of walks, hikes. 

With my partner, we used condoms %98 of the time and avoided oral sex. 

Overall, I think what really helped is, eating more and healthier because my immune system got the fuel it needed and fought the HPV but also I really believe the vaginal gel helped because HPV causes a lesion and it effects that one area in cervix. 

Also Turkey Tail Mushroom’s beta-glucan type is super important on several things and specifically helps the HPV: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25271984/

I didn’t get vaccinated because I got mixed feedback on getting vaccinated after getting rid of it. But now I will. 

You can ask me anything, I’m here to help. Many posts helped me through this so I am very happy to help anyone who is concerned. Know that this is not the end, there is a way to get rid of it, do not loose hope, this is something that your body is CAPABLE of getting rid of, just help your body and it will take care of the rest ??"	1

A. Cervix, 6:00; biopsy:
-Small focus of atypical squamous epithelium, compatible with high-grade squamous intrepithelial lesion (HSIL/CIN-2).

B. Endocervical curettage:
-Fragment of dysplastic squamous epithelium, favor high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL/CIN-2), see comment.

Comment
In part B, a fragment of dysplastic squamous epithelium is noted. The findings are favored to represent high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL/CIN-2), although definitive grading is difficult given the small, disrupted nature of the atypical epithelium.

Microscopic Description
In part A, immunohistochemistry for p16 shows moderate staining in the atypical epithelium. Ki-67 staining is increased into the superficial aspect of the atypical epithelium. In part B, p16 shows moderate staining in the atypical squamous epithelium. Ki-67 staining is also increased.

I have an appt in a little less than 2 weeks for a surgery consultation. I was told I will be getting a LEEP in the OR due to high cervix that leans to the side. 

My questions are: 
How bad is it that it went from nothing to CIN2 on cervix and ECC in 13 months? Does this mean it will continue to progress quickly?

Is the LEEP recommended or should I ask for CKC due to ECC results?  I’m ok with having surgery but do not want to have to have multiple (LEEP thenCKC) if it can be avoided.

Should I consider hysterectomy instead of LEEP or CKC? I have a child and do not want more, but my work is time sensitive with occasional travel and I can’t take a long time off for recovery.

Can I be alone for a few days following surgery? I was thinking of using points to stay at a hotel for 2-3 nights to avoid having to climb into my high bed and step around my 3 large dogs. 

Any questions you think I should ask my gyne at the consultation?

And if anyone has been in a similar situation I’d love to hear your outcome (good or bad)."	0
"Misinformation on this Subreddit Hello all, I realize I will probably get downvoted for this but I believe it's important to have realistic conversations about HPV. 

I have seen some users here who seem to be well-respected peddling some pretty bad misinformation. I just got off the phone with my doctor, and she was able to confirm that a lot of what you're seeing here is false and inaccurate. 

There are a couple of users who have made statements such as the following:

""HPV doesn't affect your ability to get pregnant or give birth.""

""High-risk HPV is not associated with symptoms.""

Both of these statements are false. HPV may be common, but it is serious. Just because 80% of people get some kind of wart on their body at some point in their lives, does not mean this disease is not a serious health concern. Additionally, the strains of HPV are very different from each other. Some only cause warts, but others cause cancer and can lead to death if left untreated. 

HPV-infected women are 6 times less likely to become pregnant within a year of trying. They are more likely to have preterm births and second trimester miscarriages. Pre-cancer treatments like LEEP also make you more likely to have a preterm birth or miscarriage because of the shortening of the cervix. This is medical fact, proven by several studies which have been replicated and peer-reviewed. If you have other information, please post a link to the specific study that says otherwise. 

High-risk HPV does come with symptoms, but not everyone experiences them. Personally, I had bleeding after sex and spotting between periods. This is considered a symptom of high-risk HPV. Anyone who tells you otherwise is incorrect. Ask any OBGYN and they will confirm that this is indeed a symptom of high-risk HPV. 

I know we don't want people to panic but we need to be HONEST with people about how serious this can be, especially if you are a young woman who wants to have children. This can absolutely impact that aspect of your life and it is extremely disingenuous to say otherwise. Playing word games, as well, like ""well, HPV doesn't make it harder to give birth"" when you know good and well - ""it's the TREATMENTS for HPV that make it harder to give birth."" Well, in that sense, HPV did make it harder for someone to have a baby because she had to have a LEEP when she was 25. Stop with the semantics and get real. We know better. The medical community knows better. DO better!!!

"I got gardasil as a teen and I was just diagnosed with Adenocarcinoma in situ 33F. I got the gardasil shots as a teen. My pap in 2019 did not show HPV, but some kind of inflammation? It was still recommended to get Pap smears every three years at this point. In 2022, I had my next Pap smear and got my first ASCUS/HPV positive test. My first colposcopy was completely negative. Then this fall I got another ASCUS positive result on my pap. I put off the colposcopy for a couple of months, thinking it was nothing to really worry about too much. I knew cancer was a possibility but it seemed like a remote one. I’m pretty healthy. I don’t smoke, I don’t drink. I don’t eat a lot of sugar. I’m not overweight, etc. 

I had my second colposcopy a few days ago. At my appointment, the doctor seemed so sure that I had nothing to worry about, saying she’d see me next year, etc. Yesterday I got the email that I had new results in my portal. Last night, I casually logged on and clicked on my test results, which showed adenocarcinoma in situ. I was shocked. I haven’t spoken to my doctor yet. I have no idea what to expect. I also don’t understand why this happened. I guess it’s possible I could have had HPV since shortly after my pap in 2019, so it could have taken nearly 5 years to turn into cancer, but I had no idea until about a year ago I had HPV.

 I honestly assumed I was safe from cervical cancer since I had gotten vaccinated, but I got HPV 16/18 anyway. I thought the vaccine is supposed to protect against those two? I don’t understand what I did wrong to make myself susceptible, other than obviously having sex like almost every other person. I never even thought about getting cancer from sex. How did I contract it when I’ve been vaccinated? Why did it turn into cancer when most people clear it? Was it working nightshift? I can’t think of what else I did to make my immunity decrease. And what happens now? It looks like eventually you need a hysterectomy, but they can try something like a cone biopsy first? And then if the margins are positive they do it again, if not it’s increased surveillance and colposcopies for life or until you get a hysterectomy? Does this sound about right? I’m kind of terrified. I don’t really know exactly what to expect, or what these procedures are like. I don’t want a hysterectomy ever. Any insight is welcome. "	-1
Massage lady with hpv? Last week i went to a massage lady..she was giving me a body scrub..while i waited for the lady to finish the body scrub we talked for a little bit and she told me that she has been seeing the docter for a quite some time to get her vagina check for an interval of 6months ..for the time being i thought it was for a pep smear regular checkup..because she told me that her grandma had the cancer but i was confused when she told me that sometimes she needed treatment..so yada yada..she opted for a hand job and fully naked service and i went for it..and we cuddle in the bathtub and i ran my fingers at her vagina and then we showered..now after some research..im worried that she might have hpv..so im panicking right now because i read that i could possibly got infected?	0
Don't be troubled Many people get worried about GW, why? There are far more deadly diseases or viruses than this. Carriers of high risk HPV rarely have symptoms. GW rarely cause cancer! Doesn't deprive you from having a child & prevent you from having sex with your partner. HPV can clear in 2years so have peace.	1
"HPV vaccine Gardasil 9 not well shaken before use, does it reduce protection?  I’m 21 years old and my OBGYN recommended I get the HPV vaccine, I picked it up at the pharmacy and went to a clinic for application, while waiting I did roll the box with the vaccine a few times very delicately. When the nurse applied it she didn’t shake it before injection, the liquid did appear kind of cloudy but I’m not sure if the components were integrated. 

She said she didn’t mix it because it was in liquid form. Now I am worried of it not being as efficient because of this and thinking of maybe getting an extra dose, any advice? "	1
"The time before vaccines As a baby, I was vaccinated against polio (and some other dreadful diseases), these vaccines still being quite a new thing at the time. The goverment was still rolling it out, and there was a campaign at the time to inform citizens to vaccinate their babies. Growing up, I remember seeing older kids who had had polio, crippled, with their legirons. I will never forget one girl I once saw, a few years older than I, she was the prettiest girl with a blue dress and pinafore like Alice in Wonderland, hobbling along with her legirons. Somehow, she had not been vaccinated, perhaps because it was still such a new thing. A few years later I had mumps, measles and rubella. And there was another ""children's disease"" we all got: chickenpox. Terrible, terrible...lesions all over your body and itching for an interminable period. The deal back then (1970's) with those diseases were when one kid in the community contracted one, the rest of us were taken to visit the kid, giving flowers and gifts, and so contract the disease ourselves. It was important that kids get these diseases while they were still young (but not too young), so they could develop an immunity. Getting those diseases as an adult may well have been a death sentence. Yes, it was all very medieval. And yes, having had these diseases, I can state that they are in fact quite terrible. 

&#x200B;

So when my kids were born in 2006 and 2008, we were urged to get the MMR and other vaccines; which we complied with religiously.

&#x200B;

I myself was vaccinated against many other diseases in my life; in the army, I don't remember what exactly but it took a week to do all the shots, and some of them were painful (I could not lift my arm afterwards). I even got vaccinated against rabies at one time; it's a two week course, IIRC. Tet (tetanus) is another one, but like the flu shot, you need to get it once a year, every year. And then all the shots you need to get whn you travel.

&#x200B;

So as human beings we have come a long way."	1
"For anyone recently diagnosed with genital warts I was diagnosed with genital warts and after about 5-6 months of imiquimod use and cryotherapy, the infection cleared up. I remember feeling such immense shame and hopelessness when I found out I had HPV, and I wish I could go back and give myself the perspective I have now. To begin with, genital warts are extremely common, but because STIs are so highly stigmatized, most people don’t know this. Apparently both my aunt and family friend had HPV, so there’s likely someone in your life who has/has had it. 

Second, it is very likely that your infection will clear up. It’s easy to skim this subreddit and hyper focus on statistics, remedies, and difficult cases, but the majority of people clear their genital warts within two years. I am guilty of doomscrolling on here and convincing myself that I’d be stuck with genital warts forever, or that I wouldn’t have sex again. 

I dated a couple people after being diagnosed, and was very open about HPV and any risks it might pose. They were both nonjudgmental, and they honestly didn’t seem to think it was a big deal. If you’re worried about genital warts ruining your sex or dating life, just know that anyone who mistreats you for having an incredibly common virus is someone who shouldn’t be in your life anyway. Think of it as a litmus test—and people might surprise you!

The shame and hopelessness you’re feeling are very real, but it can be helpful to remember that you are not gross, dirty, or unworthy because of this virus. Continue to seek advice from your doctors, lean on your support systems, and take a break from this subreddit :)"	0

"To bad no one listened to me when I warned about superbugs and tried to solve the vaccine crises a year ago with this post Antivax vs Provax solved

??

**Compromise:** Antivaxxers agree to get vaccinated, pro-vaxxers agree to give up factory farmed meat.

Not getting vaccinated poses a risk to society as a whole because of herd immunity but so does factory farmed meat, which creates pollution and gives rise to antibiotic resistant bacteria. With this compromise both sides give up a lifestyle choice which results in greater overall benefits to society as a whole.

**Why this works:**

I believe there is enough members of the antivax movement who value the benefits of lowering factory farmer meat consumption to get vaccinated and reach herd immunity. Many in the antivax movement also value lowering greenhouse gasses, lowering pathogens and pollution from factory farmed meat and treating animals more humanely. Many from the pro-vax movement value these things as well.

I believe enough pro-vaxers agreeing to this lifestyle change would convince a majority of the antivaxxers to get vaccinated. The result would be a society with herd immunity, a vastly more human animal husbandry system, as much as a 50% reduction in greenhouse gasses, lower rates of overall pollution, lower levels of superbugs that rise from antibiotic overuse in factory farms and lastly the benefits of feeling connected to people even though you disagree with them.

What I see here is a difficult compromise on both sides that has obvious and immense benefits. This is likely very few peoples dream scenario but in compromises you rarely get everything you want but you gain more through the act of giving to others. Who is willing to give up something in order to benefit society as a whole?"	0
"Will this work?? Am I just stupid?? (poly and hpv+) So I recently got the news I have hrhpv and ascus, not sure what strain, even though I was vaccinated with gardasil as a teen. I’m poly and during quarantine I’ve only been visiting my primary BF and having sex with him for like.... at least 18 months, so right now we are a closed circuit. I’m still in school though, and I was REALLY looking forward to visiting (and Fucking) some people I haven’t seen in over a year once I go back to school in the fall. The hpv diagnosis has basically dashed my hopes of getting to be intimate with any of my other partners in the next year, and I’m REALLY bummed about it.

However, I was just thinking, one partner I’m excited about seeing soon does have a cervix (we’re both transmasc) and so I really wanted to protect him and was basically thinking we couldn’t have sex at all. But, could I use a strapon in a boxer style that basically covers everything and still have sex with him, because no direct skin on skin contact in the genital area? Would that work?? 

Anyway, my primary questions are 1) is anyone here poly and have experience or advice navigating std’s with multiple partners?

And 2) what are inventive ways to have sex or be intimate without putting a partner at risk?

Thanks so much everyone."	1
I work for a pharmaceutical company and we started this anti-vax movement. Big pharma always gets the blame for cover ups, and we should. Everyone follows the money, however nobody is following the real money. We make little profit with vaccines and most major pharmaceutical companies don’t even make them. If your child comes down with an illness that is nearly eradicated we net our highest profits from their treatment. Our intention was to sell more drugs and nothing else. Are vaccines safe? We don’t actually care because people blame doctors who always fall in line with whatever it takes to keep from being sued.	0
Immune system response to vaccines compared to infection I've heard the idea that vaccines are not good for young children as it is too much of a burden on their undeveloped immune system to have it respond to multiple types of viruses at once. I don't really know enough to say what constitutes too much. But how does the immune system response (white blood cell count, antibody titer, other measures)  from a typical CDC schedule vaccination, including multiple viruses in one or multiple shots, compare to a typical infection? I'm particularly interested in things that wouldn't cause a parent too much concern, like a cold, ear infection, flu, or even chickenpox. If there is data, how does it compare with the response of actually contracting one of the diseases being vaccinated against? Is the response to a vaccine greater than that of a natural infection?	-1
"Dating with genital warts. There is hope I realized I had genital warts around February. At the time I was already starting to talk to someone I was interested in. I felt crushed when I discovered this. I felt like my life was over. I even felt suicidal. I was in such a dark and sad place. I thought dating was done for me. At least for the 6 months it would take to be certain I had cleared the virus. 

As I mentioned, I had been talking to a guy for a few weeks before this. We had never met in person. I debated just ghosting him and never mentioning it but I took a leap and put myself out there. I explained what HPV was. I didn’t self deprecate or come off not confident. I took a very factual approach and did not over exaggerate the situation. He was very open and still willing to see me. All the fears in my head were just that, fears. It wasn’t a big deal to him. 

Despite this I was still very anxious about passing anything to him and it weighed on me a lot. One day when we were hooking up, I noticed a growth at the base of his shaft. I pointed it out to him and he said he’s had it for 6 years. He had just assumed it was a skin tag as he gets them on his body. I was 95% sure it was HPV. Lo and behold, he had genital warts too. 

The moral of the story is you are not unloveable or diseased. Your dating life is not over. SO MANY people have HPV and do not have a clue. He went 6 years without a second thought. It is not that big of a deal. It is common. What are the chances that the first person Im seeing after this diagnosis also have genital warts? It just goes to show how widespread this is. Anyway I hope this helps someone stuck in the doom and gloom phase. It’ll be alright."	-1

## #3:   Vaccinated Children are the Unhealthiest, Most Chronically Sick Children

A comprehensive survey of nearly 12,000 children in the USA and  Europe was conducted in 2010. The research revealed the truth about the  health of [vaccinated vs unvaccinated kids](https://www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.com/survey-results-are-unvaccinated-children-healthier/).  The conclusion? Vaccinated children are more chronically ill than  unvaccinated children with rates for autism, ear infections, ADHD,  asthma and allergies as much as 30% higher than unvaxed children [(source)](http://web.archive.org/web/20130306034323/http://www.vaccineinjury.info/vaccinations-in-general/health-unvaccinated-children/survey-results-illnesses.html).

Another large comparative study of vaccinated versus unvaccinated children published in May 2017 unearthed similar findings [(source)](https://web.archive.org/web/20170504215400/http://oatext.com/Pilot-comparative-study-on-the-health-of-vaccinated-and-unvaccinated-6-to-12-year-old-U.S.-children.php).

Take an informal poll of the folks in your circle and see for yourself. Observation is a powerful tool, so put it to use. **The  kids with the most health and behavior problems – allergies, asthma,  ADHD, autism, coordination and other gross motor issues, and the list  goes on – are the ones that are right on track with their vaccination  schedule.**

It’s not just physical illness that plagues vaccinated children either. **Research out of Yale and Penn State demonstrated a strong association between vaccination and mental illness in children.**  95,000 children were analyzed by the Department of Public Health  Science at the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine and  Yale University. A strong association between children receiving  vaccinations and then immediate development of brain-related autoimmune  and inflammatory disorders: ADHD, OCD, anxiety, depression, bipolar,  anorexia, and chronic tic disorder was found [(source)](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyt.2017.00003/full).

For compelling anecdotal evidence, ask Moms with several children,  some of whom are vaccinated and some who are not, which of their  children are the healthiest. In my own circle, the Moms I know who have  one or two older kids who are fully vaccinated and the younger kids who  did not get any shots tell me that, hands down, that the unvaccinated  children are healthier and have less problems (usually none).

There is plenty of research available NOW for any open-minded,  thinking parent to realize that vaccination of a child is a very bad  idea. Throw out your preconceived ideas, read the science and realize  the reality that shots will very likely doom your child to a life of  autoimmune or mental disorder hell. Playing the odds for a healthy child  with a robust immune system free of mental health issues critically  involves the decision to forgo shots.

The excellent graphic below pretty much says it all. Vaccinated  children suffer from far more challenges both mentally, physically, and  behaviorally than unvaccinated children. This is the dirty little secret  Big Pharma doesn’t want you to know!

"I got my comments removed for trying to correct someone with a thorough response on how vaccines actually work. This is all in response to the idea that ""if it doesn't protect against infection, it's not a vaccine"".


Disease is the tipping point when your immune system must use a more specific and unprecedented cascade of events in order to deal with an invader. When you are exposed to a new disease, your body will try to use it's front line soldiers; neutrophils and macrophages, but they are not very good or have the ability to specifically target without training. With extensive training, they are the super soldiers of your body.


If you have no prior experience with a specific pathogen, your body has no way of specifically knowing how to fight it, even if you have a great immune system. If you do have prior experience with it, your body uses antibodies created from T Cells that fought in the previous incursions which are specifically known as a Memory T Cell. When your body has fought in a previous battle, some of the T Cells that helped create the original antibodies during that battle, will revert into a passive state, almost sentry-like. They will hang around all over your body, waiting to be activated by antigens (body parts) of the matching destroyed pathogen it was created to defend against.


*If you do not already have these Memory T Cells from a previous infection, the process of creating that weapon system from scratch can be very taxing and damaging to your own body which is what we would refer to as ""disease"". It can be especially draining while it is also trying to fight off the pathogen with the untrained front liners. Too much happening at one time. Again, it is not the pathogen doing direct damage to you.*


Think of it like bombing your own city that as a couple terrorists in it while also trying to figure out how to pinpoint them more specifically. It would obviously be better to rely on a more specific game plan than bombing your own city. But this is just the cycle your body goes through with every new pathogen. Sometimes it's an easier process, sometimes not.


A more specific look at some of the things that are happening that is very exhausting and damaging to your body would be;


* The discovery and activation of higher order immune cells other than your first contact cells.

* Gathering of antigens (pathogenic body parts) by dendritic cells (scout cells that collect said body parts to deliver to your lymph nodes and thymus gland)

* Production and training of T and B Cells.

* Opsonizing pathogens (covering of invaders with antibodies and proteins to make them easier to spot for your the rest of your immune system).

* And most of all, the indiscriminate attack of said pathogens via unfocused neutrophils and macrophages that leads to the reckless killing of your own cells as well as the pathogens, all while a more specific plan is in the works.h


It is not until your body creates a specific defense plan against that specific pathogen, will your body also be able to defend against said pathogen more discriminately and faster which no longer wastes energy that ends up damaging your body. 


*This is what is known as protection, immunity and lessening of the disease.*


You can still be ""infected"", which is an unrealistic and ignorant expectation to have for the way in which a vaccine works. Building higher and higher castle walls does not stop invaders from trying, but it will stop them from doing any real damage. They are still ""infecting"" your lands outside the castle walls but they are dealt with much easier if you have proper defenses. If your body has a specific defense plan already in place from past exposure to either the actual virus or a vaccine, you will most likely not conventionally get what is known as ""the disease"", because your body does not have to go through that arduous, dangerous and expensive process of creating a defense system anymore. Because your body already has a plan stored in it's Memory T Cells, it will be much easier to keep that pathogen under control if it ever shows up again which prevents ""the disease"", but not infection. The only way to prevent infection is to limit your exposure to potential physical encounters with that pathogen, but as mentioned before, if you already had a battle plan ready (immunity), you do not have to usually worry about being dramatically careful about exposure. Stay out of mud pits but you don't need to be in a bubble eithwr. Being infectedbis no big deal if you know how to deal with it. Obviously don't make your body fight extra battles, but that is the main difference here between infection and a disease.


Research and Development is very costly for your body to go through. If someone could just give your body the proper technology and building techniques, that would save so much time. You would be able to attack the pathogen much more directly and immediately before it reaches that tipping point, again, which is what is known as ""the disease"". The reaction you get from the vaccine provides a very similar defense plan, without the exhausting and self-harming effects associated with naturally acquiring that immunity.


*If both the vaccine and exposure to the actual virus provide a ""bullet proof vest"", having a vest does not stop bullets from firing from guns, but it is more wise to not have to shoot yourself in the foot first in order to ""naturally"" get the vest.*


There are 3 major vaccines types we have here; activated, deactivated and mRNA. These are all ways that your body is shown antigens (pathogenic body parts) in order to create this immune response which will lead to an overall immunity.


* Activated is alive but a weakened form of the virus that must be farmed in petri dishes or some other substrate. This process is very slow and can sometimes create a strong immune response since your immune system can get a ""real"" look at a somewhat functioning virus but it can also be more taxing, depending on the pathogen. This is a better option for some situations but not for all. Continued infection is possible but usually very limited as the initial pathogens in the vaccine are massively crippled and have a hard time connecting to other cells in order to replicate.

* Deactivated is a somewhat similar method as activated, as in it contains actual parts of the pathogen, but they have been ""blended"" which poses no actual threat of replication as the antigens are thrown all over the place. You need a complete cell, not just the protein receptors of a pathogen, in order to have continued infection. Typically your body just only needs access to the receptors of the pathogen in order to recognize them and create an immune response which leads to immunity. Think of receptors as a lock and key mechanism yhay cells like T and B cells are specifically created to learn how to recognize. This is the way your cells also physically connect to other cells. If the receptors match, it's like the correct key for the lock. These vaccines also need to be farmed just like the activated ones. They tend to produce a decent response but also stand no chance of replication at all as there are no complete pathogens that can replicate. This style of vaccine is also somewhat fragile as the parts tend to degrade faster than activated since they're already dismantled and on their way to decay. 

* mRNA is wholly unique in that it does not deliver the virus at all. As mentioned before, your immune system mainly uses the receptors (lock and key) to recognize what the pathogen is. That is the only part that is necessary in order to create an immune response. Everything else is unnecessary in recognizing a threat. Viruses specifically work by randomly crashing into one of our cells, uploading the entirety of its DNA or RNA, which hijacks our own cell machinery, forcing it to create more of the virus. They need our own cells to replicate. Bacteria though, simply eat our cells and use the energy to divide all on their own with their own machinery. This production of new cells is also something that happens normally but usually only happens by your own body using this feature. The act of using your cell's machinery to create things is not the issue, but what exactly it is forced to create, could be the real problem. 


Having a factory that creates 'turkey sandwiches' is not a problem. It is only when that factory is forced to produce 'poisonous BLT sandwiches' is when it becomes an issue. The mRNA vaccine is a way to tell our own machinery to instead, only create just the bacon part of the BLT. It is absolutely harmless without the other ingredients and there is no data contained within the vaccine that produces anything other than the ""bacon"". The bacon here is simply the ""lock and key"" receptor spike proteins. Without a virus body attached to these spike proteins, there is zero chance of replication of the virus. Having your body create these proteins itself means that we do not have to wait for entire viruses to be farmed in the conventional way and can instead rapidly create vaccines to combat new threats. We are using what our own body is really good at to our own advantage which is replication.


But as mentioned before, the receptor proteins are the only part your immune system really needs in order to identify an invader, whether there is an actual virus behind it or not. It will still create that immunity but now it will not have to battle any kind of further replication from the virus. It is as benign of a response as you can possibly get as of this moment. It would be like rather than having to wait for another country to send you a replacement part for one of your tools, you just use your own 3D printer at home to print your own part that is just as effective, faster to produce and can be done using your own machinery for cents on the dollar. That saves so much energy, time and resources. Think of all the gas saved in order to ship it to you. How many people handle it. All the warehouse logistics needed to store it. The downtime is also unbelievably reduced with regards to the immune system.


The big issue with vaccines nowadays, is that with the first two that were mentioned, they need to be manually farmed which takes time but also by the time they are farmed, the virus could mutate which would force you to restart the whole process to keep up. Pathogens can sometimes out pace the speed in which we can produce a corresponding vaccine. This does not mean that we are destined to create a superbug from this process. With antibiotics, that could be possible but that is a completely different mechanism of medicine that is not really at all related to this ""arms race"". The ultimate goal is to hopefully eradicate the pathogen completely. As we know, that is not always possible so the next best option is to push the pathogen to being so benign that it essentially doesn't have any complications anymore and it just becomes a normal part of life. 


Even without vaccines, this will happen but because of the more intense immune response from the actual pathogen, a lot more people will die for no reason. There are ways to nudge pathogens to this negligible state without people having to die. The virus is not actually trying to kill people but this new land (our body) is so fertile and fresh that it can't help but spread so fast that it accidentally kills us. Even it ""wants"" a more harmonious existence with us, but they are dumb, simply invade and go wild, more than they should for their own good. The fact that people are dying means that it must mutate into a less deadly disease in order to keep spreading because the viruses that were deadly, did not pass their genes on. The deadly ones cease being able to spread because they limit the times the host interacts with others because they are now dead. Viruses do not know how to make themselves less deadly; the ones that are less deadly just tend to spread more since the host remains alive to allow it to spread.


*Vaccines help to nudge this process along by making your body as uninhabitable as a dead person.*


mRNA vaccines can accelerate this process unbelievably quicker than all the others because you are not relying on the farming of potentially obsolete viruses which will then create only weak immunities. If you are taking a vaccine it is the best idea possible to take one that creates the more direct ans specific response.


So with all of this in mind, that is what is the difference between infection and disease is. Infection is simply ""having the pathogen on or in your body"" which no vaccine could ever protect against. A bullet proof vest does not keep you from getting shot. A disease is when your body not only allows the pathogen to spread to unmanageable levels, but also has to devote a lot of resources, which is damaging to itself, in order to create a battle plan while also trying to fight the invader while causing a lot of harm to itself in the battle.


*If we did not have to devote a massive amounts of our budget to military expenditures, we could use those resources for other things. Sometimes it is necessary to have such a large military but if we can make it more efficient, why would we not? If we can have the exact same military size and power, but cut out a lot of the bureaucratic slow downs, why would we not prefer that?*


If we can make our bodies simulate the environment of a dead person, as in an environment that the virus can not spread in, it will have no choice but to revert to a less deadly version of itself to the point where we don't even need vaccines anymore. Viruses do not actually want to kill us, that does not benefit them. Finding a way to become completely undetected, which means essentially harmless, is the goal here for them and us. If something becomes so harmless that it doesn't even really cause problems, why would we even care about it anymore? It is the process of getting it to that point which is the deadly game. If we have a choice between risking people dying to get to that point or people not dying, why would we not choose the latter?

"Safe sex practices with HPV Hi,
First of all, sorry for my english.

I’ve been dating a guy for one month.
I told him about my HPV, he had his first gardasil 9 shot and will have his final one in 6 month.

I would like to find some alternatives to have fun without compromising his sexual health.

He is very open minded to try everything.

He is willing to be pegged.

That’s all I’ve got so far ??

Do you have any idea of scenarios, toys, wtv that could do the tricks? 

Thanks a lot"	0
"Anyone want to help me spread a rumor? I'd like to tell anti-vaxxers that doctors have started putting essential oils in vaccines instead of ""harmful chemicals"", and that vaccines are actually a lot safer now. But doctors aren't supposed to talk about it because they don't want to admit they were wrong, so they won't tell you if you ask about it.

You can't fight stupid with science, but maybe we can out-stupid them?"	1
"Anti vaxxers everywhere? Before the pandemic, I honestly thought anti-vaxxers were a negligible sized community in society. However, there seems to a large prevalence of anti-vaxxers in Toronto, including friends, family members and co-workers. 

I'm just seriously fucking irritated because I want life to go back to normal. The worst part is anti-vaxxers are usually anti-lockdown too. Did they ever think that maybe if everyone got the vaccine, cases would plummet and we could finally move past stage 3? Probably not.


I really wish everyone would just get vaccinated so life will go back to normal. Also, when I refer to life going back to normal, I don't mean the exact same as before, I know covid is here to stay!"	1
"I cleared it!!! I’m still a little bit in shock, from good news, but I got the call from my OBGYN this morning that I somehow came back with a normal pap, AND tested negative for HPV. this feels like a blessing that I never expected to receive.

In March I had a LEEP that wasn’t successful. I still had CIN 2 at my margins and my OBGYN basically told me that my next step after my pap would be another colpo, then another LEEP or a cone biopsy.

She didn’t think I could clear the HPV because of my stress level and because I’m a smoker. I never thought I’d clear it on my own. 

I’ve been in a huge state of depression ever since the LEEP came back with CIN on the margins, just expecting my next surgery and months and months more of anxiety and trauma, and then today I was told that it’s over.

I’m having trouble really processing it or believing it’s real, I knew it could in theory happen, that my body could clear it on its own, I just never expected it to. I did take AHCC, and got the newer guardasil shots, but other than that didn’t do anything special. There feels like no way in hell I should’ve gotten this lucky and I don’t know how I did.

I feel like it’s gonna take some time for me to feel at home in my own body again, this experience really traumatized me in a way that won’t leave me so easily, but I am going to try and envision a future in which I could feel “all good” with my body again. Cautiously optimistic, and wanted to share!

"trying to remember the name of a prominent antivax person from the 00s I used to work for a chiropractor in the 00s and they got very into antivax stuff. I even got sucked into it for a little while (I was young) but I eventually got my head on and it's part of why I left the job. They had me attend a talk given by a prominent antivaxxer of the ""vaccines cause autism"" flavour. She advocated taking huge doses of vitamin C and breastfeeding children until they were six or seven. I think she was European (maybe German?) Does anyone know who I'm taking about?   


Every so often I remember this and curiosity makes me want to check in to see if she recanted or got entertainingly discredited or something, but it's making me nuts that I can't remember her name. Thanks in advance; keep getting your shots!

"Unpopular opinion: 1,000's of NZer's will die a slow painful death in this current outbreak. As soon as we hit maximum ICU capacity we will see people get turned away from hospitals to die on the streets. Turkey for example has 10 times the ICU capacity per capita of NZ and we all know what happened there, tens of thousands of people died horrible deaths. 

Getting vaccinated is our best defence. Even if the vaccine makes you a little sick afterwards, it will make getting Covid less awful when it inevitably happens."	1
"Avoiding pitfalls in the pursuit of a COVID-19 vaccine I can highly recommend this article from the PNAS. It gives a very readable overview of some of the ways that vaccines go wrong and provides some insight as to why the Dengue Vaccine (Dengvaxia) appeared to be 80.2% effective, but caused more severe disease in some patients. Vaccine development is not as easy and straight forward as some might think.  

""Researchers need to understand in particular whether the vaccine causes the same types of immune system malfunctions that have been observed in past vaccine development. Since the 1960s, tests of vaccine candidates for diseases such as dengue, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have shown a paradoxical phenomenon: Some animals or people who received the vaccine and were later exposed to the virus developed more severe disease than those who had not been vaccinated ([**1**](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/03/27/2005456117#ref-1)). The vaccine-primed immune system, in certain cases, seemed to launch a shoddy response to the natural infection. “That is something we want to avoid,” says Kanta Subbarao, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne, Australia.

This immune backfiring, or so-called immune enhancement, may manifest in different ways such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), a process in which a virus leverages antibodies to aid infection; or cell-based enhancement, a category that includes allergic inflammation caused by Th2 immunopathology. In some cases, the enhancement processes might overlap. Scientific debate is underway as to which, if any, of these phenomena—for which exact mechanisms remain unclear—could be at play with the novel coronavirus and just how they might affect the success of vaccine candidates.""

"Isn't it interesting how vaccine injuries are the leading motivator for anti-vaccine activism? What that implies is, that someone was at one point willing to get a vaccine, and then got a vaccine injury from that vaccine. 

So they can't really say that this person is ""anti-vaccine"", because this person actually got vaccinated. 

Anti-vaccine people, are mostly Ex-vaccine people. 

They were pro-vaccine enough to go along and get whatever vaccines were required. 

Then they had a bad experience, and stopped taking vaccines, and became Ex-vaccine, 

And then thru their road to recovery, they dig a lot deeper into vaccines, and vaccine problems, 

And then they are called ""anti-vaccine"" when they share what they learn, with people they care about.

Autism is the leading cause of anti-vaccine activism on twitter.

This graphic, created by Vaccinate California Co-Founder Renee DiResta, breaks down antivax activism into sub groups. ""Conservatives"" are green, ""Anti-Vax"" is purple, and ""Autism"" is orange. Clearly, Autism is the single greatest motivator for antivax activism.

Am I pregnant or do I have cervical cancer?? Hi I'm a 20 y/o Female and for starters I am not nor have I ever been sexualy active. I have been feeling weird and bloated in my lower abdomen. I disregarded it until I began to feel strange. I felt my cervix and it doesn't feel donut shaped but moreso like a cone? I have been having cramps and my stomach hurts fairly often but I don't look any different besides minor weight gain. I know that the cervical cancer part might seem like a stretch but I heard that it is mostly credited to Hpv or something similar. I doubt I am pregnant as I had my period last month but it was way heavier than usual and the cramping was unbelievable. I am honestly afraid that it could be cervical cancer and that it could affect any future relationships I get into and my physical health. What do I do?	0
"Update since my LEEP experience back in April + for those who are also trying to get pregnant after LEEP This past April I got a LEEP for HPV positive with CIN2 and CIN3 on my cervix. My doctor said she wanted to be aggressive yet gentle treating my cervix because of my age (f25) + my husband and I were actively trying to get pregnant before I found out I had HPV. She knew I was eager to start trying again after LEEP. I went for my post-op in May and she said I was healing nicely. I asked her how soon I could start trying again to get pregnant. She said they generally see patients 6 months after their LEEP for a pap smear to see if they test positive for HPV. She said we could schedule a pap in 4 months but she left it up to my husband and I to decide when we wanted to start trying again. Honestly, finding out that I had HPV in the middle of trying to have a baby was extremely disappointing. We had no idea how long we would have to wait until we could try again. 

We took some time to think about it but naturally we were eager to start again so after my post-op that’s exactly what we did. We knew there was a risk that the LEEP wasn’t fully successful as my margins were not clear however my doctor said she had treated all the margins during LEEP, so there was a chance everything would be fine. She also made it clear that I *could* have a high risk pregnancy if the LEEP wasn’t successful. With this in mind, we took the risk. 

Honestly, after my LEEP I felt different. My periods were starting to normalize again and they weren’t as painful as before. I made some minor adjustments to help aid my recovery and boost my immune system but we just went on as normal with life. Then in July we got pregnant! I found out in early August. It was exactly what we wanted. I went to my OB during my 9 week appointment and explained my history and how recently I had just had my LEEP. She said we would need to do a pap to see if I was still HPV positive. If my pap did come back positive, we would need to do a colposcopy to see the development of the cell changes. Hearing that I would possibly need another colposcopy (in the same year) honesty made me sick to think about. It was a deeply unpleasant experience during my first colpo and I had hoped that I would never need to do it again. 

Thankfully, I got my results this morning and my pap came back clear and was negative for HPV! I’m 10 weeks now and so far so good. Of course, I will need yearly paps until I have three clear results before I can go back to a pap every three year schedule but this was a huge huge relief. 

I’m thankful my doctor suggested the LEEP for my case specifically. It did seem fast at first as I had only found out I was HPV positive in February. It was aggressive and difficult to deal with but I believe that it helped clear me of the infection faster rather than waiting to see how it developed in 1 year. She listened to my goal of wanting to get pregnant and acted fast for me. I’m grateful that this nightmare seems to be over now. "	1
"Did you know that 555 people out of 327.2 MILLION have contracted a non-fatal virus called measles this year? Wow, that’s about 0.0000017% of the US population. Sounds pretty scary, right?  

Did you know that measles outbreaks occur in vaccinated populations?  And measles is a side effect of the measles vaccine? Wait, does that  mean the vaccines aren’t working?  

Major measles epidemic in the region of Quebec despite a 99% vaccine coverage.

The vaccination coverage among cases was at least 84.5%. Vaccination  coverage for the total population was 99.0%. Incomplete vaccination  coverage is not a valid explanation for the Quebec City measles  outbreak. Canadian Journal of Public Health. 1991

[Evidence that vaccines do not provide real immunity.](https://www.learntherisk.org/news/measles-madness/?fbclid=IwAR3cq2-MujpZ-hOCOMs82D9ZnH-G9Ip3VIZDeDbIq6BakIwVtPYmA7mfeyw)Since vaccines are given by injection, they bypass the normal immune pathway and therefore do not trigger the cellular immune system, which science shows to be the main component necessary to create immunity. 

While the measles vaccine doesn’t reduce measles deaths, the vaccine does inject a live virus into children, some of who will end up developing measles. Yes, you read that right. The measles vaccine can cause measles. It’s even listed as a possible side effect of the vaccine on the [manufacturer’s product information sheet.](https://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/UCM123789.pdf)

The MMR measles vaccine product label shows measles as a potential reaction to the vaccine.[Source:](https://www.learntherisk.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/screen-shot-2019-01-30-at-11.10.05-300x139.png)

And here’s more proof: 38% of measles cases that were tested in the 2015 US outbreak were vaccine strain measles. So if an average of 40% of cases is the vaccine strain, it means the vaccine is causing these  cases. Will mandating further vaccines reduce measles… or increase it?

“During the measles outbreak in California in 2015, a large number of suspected cases occurred in recent vaccines. Of the 194 measles virus sequences obtained in the United States in 2015, [73 were identified as vaccine sequences”.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/9824838/)

"My parents are anti-vaxxers and I'm feeling a bit lost. Hi all - I'm 19 and haven't gotten my vaccine yet because my parents are EXTREMELY against the COVID vaccine. They have told me that the vaccine will destroy my immune system over time, that it causes infertility, that it's not FDA approved and therefore is illegitimate, that it's a depopulation tool, and other very troubling ""facts"". I have done my research and know this not to be true. But my parents say that the media and scientists have all been paid off by big pharma and that none of the positive studies are actually true.

I really want to get the vaccine but psychologically I am having trouble getting myself to do it. I know that my parents are wrong but a part of me still is very nervous about what they are saying, especially infertility, since that has always been a huge worry of mine since I didn't get my period until I was 18. So if any of you could provide any specific advice as to why I should get the vaccine/what I should do in my situation, I'd really appreciate it.

They would be so so angry with me if I got it. It would basically destroy my relationship with my parents. My parents think that vaccinated people will make unvaccinated people sick because vaccinated people have a ""spike protein"" that they can transmit to others and that is very harmful. So they think I would be putting them in danger by getting the vaccine.

Please advise...

(PS, I have been double masking everywhere and wearing gloves and getting Covid tests every few weeks to be safe. I know it's selfish not to have the vaccine so I have been trying to compensate.)"	1
"I support the idea of vaccinations in theory… But the notion that all vaccines are 100% harmless and that we just shouldn’t inquire about the nature of them to educate ourselves, is complete bullshit, and it actively makes people distrust vaccinations. For example, the company Pfizer has a long and storied history of lying about, tampering with, and suppressing the trials and test results of drugs they develop. This is a fact. Not up for debate. In literally any other context, wouldn’t this be enough for any reasonable person to question any product, vaccination or not, from this company? How is this not a valid reason to question? And how does my questioning make me a “crazy antivaxxer”? I’m not. Im not even against vaccines and think they’re largely beneficial. I’m just someone who doesn’t trust shady ass companies with a history of lying. Especially when they want to put something in my body, and benefit financially from doing so. 
And honestly, as much as you guys like to dehumanize them, I think this is all that most “antivaxxers” are. And it’s pretty clear that the attitude you have towards their perfectly reasonable mistrust only drives them further into extremism."	-1
"Where did all this heresy about vaccines come out from? I was waiting at my doctor's office to get the booster shot yesterday. There was a woman with her child waiting to enter another office. She asked what I was doing there. When she heard my reply, she said that I was making a huge mistake and that all this booster shot only proves that the vaccine doesn't work.

&#x200B;

I tried to be nice and said that the doctor knew better. But it seems that she was determined to prove that I was wrong and started telling me about her mom, who died after having the first dose. And that she'll never allow her son to get vaccinated. It's all only a way of making people sterile.

&#x200B;

When I asked her if she was vaccinated against anything, she enumerated every shot she got in her childhood. At my reply that it didn't prevent her from giving birth, she shut up. But in a few seconds, she started another talk about masks being ineffective and that there's no point in wearing them.

&#x200B;

Thank God that my doctor invited me in, and I wasn't forced to listen to her enlightening speech anymore. When I related our conversation to my doctor, he said that half of the persons entering his office told him the same, and there are many people among his colleagues who believe that nonsense. He advised me to continue using masks and sanitizer for my own sake.

When I returned home, the first thing that I did was order another pack of disposable masks from the online [safety supplies](https://harmonycr.com/) store.

"I would like some answers (if possible) to these vaccine questions I'm anti vaccine, I just have questions that I don't see being answered.
First, there has never been a vaccinated Vs completely unvaccinated study. That study should be important to everyone, pro vax or anti vax.

Second, everyone on the News is saying how deadly measles is, but no one has died in 19 years or more to my knowledge in America. I know about the ""measles death"" in 2003 and 2015, but people only thought they had had measles after the post mortem, and both people were already sick. 

Thirdly, when Paul Offit, or someone like him says that vaccines don't cause autism, I just will say that to me, that is a complete lie. There have been 19 studies about the MMR vaccine and autism, three studies about thimersol and MMR and autism, and 6 studies about just thimersol and autism. Now, I don't know about you, but that is wrong on a lot of different levels. For one, all of these studies I just mentioned were funded by the industry which would make money if thimersol and the MMR didn't cause autism. Another disturbing thing about this is that NONE of those studies used a saline placebo! No one can prove that vaccines are safe, or don't cause autism, without a saline placebo. Also, what about the 15 other vaccines that have never been tested for causing autism? You see, you really can't mandate vaccines that have never had a proper safety study. 

I could say much more about why at this present time, I don't trust vaccines, but first I would really appreciate it if you guys could tell me where I'm wrong, or where I'm not getting my facts straight. I would love to be wrong on this, and be able to stop believing thousands of children's lives have been messed up by this product. I am just saying my concerns, and will listen rationally to anything you guys have to say. Thanks!"	-1

"Long flu may be more harmful to the brain than COVID https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000209248


Long flu and brain damage

Severe flu might leave a longer-lasting impact on the brain than a comparably severe COVID infection.

The study reveals that patients hospitalized with the flu were nearly twice as likely to seek medical help for neurological problems in the year after their illness compared to those hospitalized with COVID.

This includes a 44% increased chance of needing treatment for nerve pain, a 35% higher likelihood of battling persistent migraines, and up to a 10% greater risk of needing care for stroke or dementia.

Long flu risks: Inflammation and beyond

The question is, why might the flu pose a greater long-term risk to the brain than COVID? While the research is ongoing, here's what we know:

Inflammation

Both flu and COVID can cause widespread inflammation throughout the body. This inflammation can harm blood vessels, including those within the brain, potentially setting the stage for complications.

Direct brain invasion

In some cases, these viruses can directly infect the brain, leading to encephalitis (brain swelling).

Autoimmune confusion

These infections may trigger autoimmune reactions, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks nerves.

Insights from the findings

""While the results were not what we expected to find, they are reassuring in that we found being hospitalized with COVID did not lead to more care for common neurological conditions when compared to being hospitalized with influenza,"" explained lead researcher, Dr. Brian Callaghan.

This study underscores the importance of protecting our brains – not just from COVID but from a wide range of illnesses. Here's what you can do:

Vaccinate for long flu and COVID-19
Flu and COVID-19 vaccines significantly reduce your risk of severe illness and long-term complications.

Don't delay your treatments
Seek prompt medical care if you experience a severe infection of any kind. Early intervention can be a game-changer, significantly affecting the outcome.

"Teens, how to get vaccinated despite having antivaxx parents / guardians. Teens, if you want to be fully vaccinated, but your anti-vaxx parents are refusing, don't despair, depending on your age, you can still get up to date in all your vaccines.  In fact, getting properly vaccinated, and ensuring you have proper preventative health care, is the PERFECT way to show you understand you have the right to control your own body.

How you do this is to look up your states' laws and check what the age limit is for you to get vaccinated without parental permission.  All 50 states has laws stating their age limits for minor consent, as does the US territories and most other nations do as well.  For some it's as young as 12, for some it's as old as 16.  Though, sadly, some states do not allow you to have that right until you turn 18.

These laws allow you to get some health care without your parents' permission, in fact you don't have to tell them a thing if you don't want to.  Though I never encourage teens to hide things from their parents, they should be open and honest, but also careful.  But still, it is up to you to let your parents know if you make the choice, or if you don't want them to know, well, HIPAA law states you have that right as well.

For more information, ask your local physician, an actual physician not naturopaths or holistic healers, and ask them to help you figure out the age limit you need to be to get your shots without having to be held back.  Remember teens, it really IS your choice.

In Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina,Tennessee, Washington and West Virginia, young men and women aged 12 and up can go and get their vaccinations without any parental permission or consent.

In Washington DC, the age limit is 11 years old, kids starting at 11 can get vaccinated without parental permission if they wish.

[https://www.vaxteen.org/consent-laws-by-state](https://www.vaxteen.org/consent-laws-by-state)

And teens, if you live in the UK, if living in the UK then you can ask to take the competency test to prove you understand enough to make decisions on your own medical care and get vaccinated even if your anti-vaxx parents say no. It's known as the Gullick Competency.

"Can't watch a family member die I'm looking for online data sources presenting clinical data on the safety of mRNA vaccines to refute arguments in a debate I'm having with a really stubborn family member. 

I contacted the CDC and they referred me to the FDA and the FDA sent me a letter referring me to their website ([clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/)) for ""definitive information"" on the safety of mRNA vaccines. After doing a simple keyword search for mRNA vaccines, the total number of trials was about 241. After filtering on just the trials where Study Results = 'Has Results', there were only 9, with the longest duration one being only 4 years with only 15 participants.

I would imagine the FDA has data stored somewhere else that documents the safety of the mRNA approach through tried and true clinical trials? Does anyone know of any other locations where solid data is available for the public?  I'm not looking for anecdotal stuff like millions have taken it and no one is dead yet.  I need hard data to support the argument and I'm having a hard time finding hard data even though I've written AND received letters from both the CDC and FDA pointing to their clinical trails website."	1
"Needing reassurance please. Hi All, please be kind and don’t judge me.
Ever since covid started I have become extremely vaccine hesitant. I delayed getting the c19 vax and only ended up getting a single dose.
My husband and I started trying for a baby and we’re told by doctor to get vaccinated for rubella. I did with no hesitation.
I also got tdap while pregnant with no hesitation. 

I don’t know what on earth has happened to me but I am LITREALLY petrified of vaccinating my baby. I refused the hep b at birth and only gave baby vitamin k. 

After a lot of convincing and reassurance from my mum I gave her the scheduled 2 month dose but not she’s almost 5 months and I haven’t taken her back for the next dose.

I just keep seeing videos of babies dying of SIDS days after their vaccination or the other day I saw a video of a baby girl that died of cardiac arrest at 15 months old within 24hours of getting vaccinated. 

I’m an absolute wreck, I keep having this mental debate whether I should or should vaccinate her further. It’s all I can think about and it’s taking over my life ??

Don’t worry I don’t believe the whole autism bs it’s more the other things I’ve mentioned.
Aluminium adjuvants that are neurotoxic etc etc
I even considered vaccinating her with the vaccines that don’t have the aluminium adjuvants. 

I’m just rambling now. I’m really desperate for some reassurance and rationale as I’m feeling extremely anxious and vulnerable. 

Thank you in advance"	-1
"Just a thought about Vaccine injures. 1. When antivaxxer are doing their ""own research"", don't they realize that the number 1 vaccine injury is Anaphylaxis, aka an allergy reaction. You can get tested for allergies, and you can get alternative vaccines that don't cause a reaction. When my gf said when he are getting kids, to have them tested as my gf is allergic to certain medications, to make sure the baby doesn't have a reaction.

All other major vaccine injuries I researched are 

A:  caused by the patients fainting do to a trigger (""Aka fainting due to sign of a needle or blood"")  
B: An injury from improperly putting the needle in  
C: Pre-existing condition from an auto-immune disorder.

"Stay away from escorts guys, I caught 3 STD'S after having sex only 2 times. (No they were not drug addicts or homeless people and I did not go raw)   Idk why so many men encourage other people to see them and tell the world that they're ""clean,"" lol. First of all HPV can't be tested for in men, and only the high-risk strains are tested for in women. That leaves the low-risk wart strains undetectable and transmittable, plus 99% of people are asymptomatic when catching these strains so they won't even know they have it.  When it comes to Herpes tests, they're not even accurate. You can test negative and be positive. All it takes is a person like me who DOES get symptoms to expose what infections a person really has. I caught Ghonnorea and HPV the first time I ever had sex WITH A CONDOM and it did not break. Condoms aren't even 100% effective against bacterial infections, so it's possible. I caught HPV but I didn't get symptoms of the genital kind until a few months later, but I did get hand warts about a week later from simply touching her body (not her genitals). This just shows what kind of viruses and bacteria are lingering on these girls. I got the Ghonnorea treated and figured that it was just bad luck and so I saw another one about 3 weeks after the first and then I quit seeing them due to the fear of catching more STD'S. After about 3 months of not seeing them I started developing genital warts, which I thought was the only thing that I caught but then 2 years later I had a random genital herpes outbreak because it stayed dormant that long. I obviously caught it from one of those girls aswell. Those were my only sexual encounters ever, and I've been celibate for 3 years since then. This reckless behavior happened during a phase of depression because im ugly and was never going to get a regular woman anyway, but the STD'S really solidified it. "	-1

Immune system response to vaccines compared to infection I've heard the idea that vaccines are not good for young children as it is too much of a burden on their undeveloped immune system to have it respond to multiple types of viruses at once. I don't really know enough to say what constitutes too much. But how does the immune system response (white blood cell count, antibody titer, other measures)  from a typical CDC schedule vaccination, including multiple viruses in one or multiple shots, compare to a typical infection? I'm particularly interested in things that wouldn't cause a parent too much concern, like a cold, ear infection, flu, or even chickenpox. If there is data, how does it compare with the response of actually contracting one of the diseases being vaccinated against? Is the response to a vaccine greater than that of a natural infection?	0

"Not vaccinated as a child, what to do now? Hey everyone, I (F24) was raised by anti-vax parents. They were well-intentioned and while I strongly disagree with them, I know they were doing what they thought was right. However, I also know that the misinformation they were crediting as “medical research” was obviously incredibly misled and am somewhat concerned about my health as an adult. 

Am I able to receive all the vaccines I never got as a child as an adult? Are there certain vaccines I should prioritize? I did get both COVID shots plus the booster as well as one flu shot, but so far that is all I have ever received. 

I am extremely worried about my vulnerability to diseases. I am healthy, no chronic health issues besides mild asthma and some gastrointestinal sensitivities. However, I have gotten some extreme sicknesses in the last decade or so (rare, but they have happened) that probably would have only been a bad flu if not for my body being at a low defense level due to a lack of vaccines. For example, I got a flu when I was 17 that resulted in multiple days of dangerously high fever, extreme dehydration, convulsions, etc. Again, this has only happened about three times in 10 years, but I am acutely aware that that is not even remotely normal in the modern age for a regular flu in a healthy young body. I am not a doctor and have no idea how any of this works, but the concern is there. 

Any help or advice is appreciated. Just want to be healthy and properly protected against diseases. Thank you!!

Herpes Simplex Virus Found to Double Dementia Risk, New Study Reveals A new study from Uppsala University has found that individuals with a history of herpes simplex virus infection are twice as likely to develop dementia compared to those uninfected. Analyzing data from 1,000 participants over 15 years, researchers confirmed previous findings linking the virus to dementia risk. This study emphasizes the importance of exploring existing antiviral treatments and potential vaccines to reduce dementia risk, driving further research into early intervention strategies for this widespread condition affecting millions globally.

Newborn hep b shots right after birth. Im about to have a kiddo , and doing  my research on what shots and when .  I have been diving Into each ingredient and why it's in the vaccine. After reading much research on the hep b with AL as an ingredient and how it starts  a large  immunal response . Along with tracking it through the body and how it can end up past the BBB .   One large study suggests waiting  for the infants BBB to develop before introducing  AL. From my understanding the BBB doesn't fully develop till 4 months and even waiting a month maybe a good idea.  The mother of the child does not have hepB  so transfer from her wouldn't be a problem. ( that seems to be the number 1 way for an infant to get hep b) .  I guess my question is , is it okay for me to want to wait to get the the first hepB shot allowing  my kid some time to develop the BBB? Thoughts ?	0

"Cleared high-risk HPV after 9 years! Hi friends, just want to share some happy news with you all. I was diagnosed with high risk HPV at 19 in college. After diagnosis, I stayed consistent with annual gyno follow-up visits and every year the same process occurred: we did a Pap smear that would come back positive for high risk HPV, followed by a colposcopy to take a closer look (luckily cells were always low-grade, abnormal but only pre cancer).

I got so used to the process and was convinced I would never clear the virus after so many years. It actually caused A LOT of health anxiety in my early 20’s and I worried about cervical cancer a lot. Over time, my anxiety lessened, but it was still a concern for me in the back of my mind. 

Well I’m 28 now and just had an annual gyno visit. The pap results are NEGATIVE for HPV and came back completely normal. No colposcopy needed. I’m so happy and can’t believe that after 9 years it seems like I’ve finally cleared the virus. Just wanted to share this and hope it helps someone who’s stressing out there. I thought I’d have this forever and that cancer was a certainty. That isn’t the case!

Take care of yourselves, friends. I didn’t do anything special to clear it, I just try to eat somewhat healthily and move my body regularly. Wishing negative tests for you all!"	1
"Anyone who hates on anti-vaxxers without understanding their own vaccines wore off years ago is a hypocrite Most vaccines don't give you immunity for the rest of your life. Even with all the recommended booster shoots at different ages through childhood, a lot of them will still just give you 5-15 years immunity. This isn't a controversial claim ([http://www.immune.org.nz/vaccines/efficiency-effectiveness](http://www.immune.org.nz/vaccines/efficiency-effectiveness) \- government health website showing the length of immunity provided by each specific vaccine), its literally how vaccines work and isn't disputed by any reputable scientist, anywhere. I only found it out when I had to show I'd gotten my vaccines for a green card, they told me I could get a 'titer test' instead of getting records from home country, and the titer test showed I had no immunity anymore.

&#x200B;

I do think if you can only require \*one single\* age group to be immune, going after young kids where you can make sure their immunity only wears of at about age 20ish, does make the most sense as a) they are slightly more vulnerable to some diseases and b) they tend to live in closer proximity to others (in schools, dorms, etc), but I still think anyone who posts online insulting anti-vaxxers without

&#x200B;

a) actually getting off their butt as an adult to check with a titer test if they still have immunity

&#x200B;

b) read the side effects for the vaccines they need to get (from the CDC [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm))

and c) get vaccinated when they find out they're not immune anymore and are also just benefiting from herd immunity is a hypocrite.

I dislike anti-vaxxers, but I also dislike pro-vaxxers that don't bother to get even a basic understanding of how they work and just spend all their time ranting about 'mommy bloggers' and insulting people who use 'herd immunity' even though most of their vaccines have worn off and they're using the exact same thing.

"UPDATE: This hesitant (38F) mama vaccinated her kids today. Awhile back I asked for some support getting over my vaccine hesitancy which started when my daughter had a reaction 11 years ago. It was not taken seriously and I was treated very poorly which began my mistrust in the system. I didnt mention my other 2 kids because I didnt want extra hate, and the information I got would have been the same anyway.

Today my 3 kids (12, 5, and 2) got their vaccines. And not just 1 vaccine (Because I figured I would be too chicken to do more) but 2 vaccines. MMRV and DTAP-IPV. We go back in a few weeks to continue their boosters and to schedule the rest of the vaccines. They should be caught up in a year. The nurse was kind and very proud of me and my kids.

And just so you know, how you doctors talk to parents will push them off the fence, you gotta find a way that pushes them to the right side of it, because the antivax group will welcome them with open arms and listen to their story and counter with ""facts"" about how your child has been hurt. Had I not been talked down to like a bad mother who was over reacting when her child wasnt doing well after vaccines, I probably would have continued vaccinating, but instead my kids went years without protection.

"Pap smear clear; HPV negative, but CIN2 picked up visually during colposcopy. Hi everyone, 

I'm writing this to understand, and because I've had a family history of cancer - I'm perhaps a little more paranoid.

For context, I've been with my partner for a number of years and I am incredibly diligent about doing Pap smears regularly (yearly).

In August 2022 before moving to the UK, I had my usual Pap smear + test for HPV - all came back clear, at the same time I had a mirena inserted. It's my second mirena, but my body has reacted a lot differently this time. I had quite a bit of spotting/bleeding post insertion, but I was assured this was normal. When reunited with my husband in October 2022, started getting breakthrough bleeding after having sex. I then started raising concerns with my local GP/sexual healthcare clinic and after a battery of potential answers (STD screenings etc) I was assured this was normal. 

April 2023 it was time for my first Pap smear here in the UK, and it was confirmed that I was **HPV negative**. However breakthrough bleeding persisted. 

&#x200B;

I was referred for an ultrasound - that came back clear and then I was referred to a gynaecologist, but the first available appointment was early March. 

I attended this appointment, had an exam done, and the gynaecologist said he could see slight cervical ectropia and referred me to a colposcopist who could potentially cauterize and I could be on my way! 

Fast forward to this past Saturday, where I attended the colposcopy appointment - thinking it'll be super quick and the problem will be sorted. On visual inspection the colposcopist picked up that yes, there is cervical ectopia, and this is most likely the cause of my bleeding, but he also picked up 3 areas of concern with moderate to severe cell changed (suspects CIN 2 / CIN 3). They have been sent off for biopsy - which will take around 4 weeks I believe.

&#x200B;

But my question is this: 

\- Could the colposcopist be wrong? 

\- Could something else be the cause of these cell changes? 

\- How do you ever trust in just a Pap smear result again if it's been completely undetected through all of these tests/years?

I know I'm going to have to wait for the biopsy results, but I'm having such a hard time wrapping my head around having done everything right, and if it weren't for the bleeding (that appears to be unrelated), I may never have known that there was an issue??"	0

"HSV vs HPV: why the language of herpes doesn't apply to HPV In many ways, HSV is the  better-understood and better-known skin infection that is often sexually transmitted. For that reason, people who are new to HPV often assume that the same things apply. But, I think it's unhelpful to operate in this paradigm, because these are fundamentally different viruses. For example, I often notice people talk about HPV 'outbreaks'. I don't like using this term because, while it fits well with what we know about HSV, it doesn't really apply to HPV and can cause confusion.

Disclaimer: not a doctor, open to correction.

**What do we know about HSV?**

HSV (herpes simplex) infects the skin - in particular, it prefers mucosal skin or the areas bordering it, i.e. the genitals or the borders of the mouth.

HSV has two types, HSV1 and HSV2. Until recently, HSV1 was more commonly found in the mouth, leading to a common misconception that it can *only* infect the mouth; however, mainly due to changing social habits (not kissing kids when you've got a coldsore, leading to fewer infant infections, and more oral sex given to women), increasing numbers of HSV1 infections are genital. HSV2 is more commonly genital, although in some less common cases can be oral. Having one of the strains genitally or orally provides quite good (although not robust) protection against having it in another location, because of the antibodies you produce.

HSV is incredibly common. It depends on the country, but in most places around 70%+ have some kind of HSV1 infection, and around 20%+ have some kind of HSV2 infection. However, many of those people will not know about it, as they never experience visible symptoms or recognise what they experience as being related to HSV. It's also pretty normal for people not to know that coldsores on the mouth are herpes.

HSV is a lifelong infection. After infecting the skin, [it travels down into the nerves](https://news.feinberg.northwestern.edu/2021/11/17/how-herpes-checks-into-the-nervous-system-for-life/) and stays there. That's why they have found it difficult to create a vaccine (preventative or therapeutic) for herpes!

[HSV periodically reactivates and travels back along the nerves to the skin](https://www.acog.org/womens-health/experts-and-stories/ask-acog/why-does-herpes-cause-repeated-outbreaks), where it can produce visible symptoms (commonly called outbreak). These reactivations are usually triggered by something, whether that's illness, stress, sunlight or certain foods.

When there is a reactivation, the virus becomes transmissible. This is most obviously the case when there is a visible outbreak, but sometimes it can reactivate and be present on the skin but not cause visible symptoms. This is how HSV can be passed on without visible sores.

Regardless, the usual advice for HSV is to avoid sex during a visible outbreak as this is when it's most likely to pass on. People with HSV should also disclose to new partners because there's that small chance of transmission even without visible symptoms. Using condoms and antiviral medication can drastically reduce the risk of transmission by reducing the area of skin touching other skin, and reducing the frequency of reactivations.

HSV outbreaks usually last from a few days up to a couple of weeks and it will be obvious when they have healed up.

Many people will get fewer outbreaks over time as the immune system works to prevent them, and some people will only get one (or none).

If you check out r/herpes you will see that there are actual details about transmission risk for different forms of HSV, and lots of tips for how to manage it. There are plenty of couples who manage to avoid transmission.

**What do we know about HPV?**

In short, *a lot less.*

HPV infects the skin cells and doesn't migrate to the nerves. We know that over time, the body's immune system deals with the infection so it becomes undetectable through standard PCR testing, i.e. it is considered inactive.

There are over 150 different types of HPV and over 30 that can infect the genitals and mouth. Lots of these won't ever have any symptoms and almost everyone will get one or more types in our lifetimes, most without even knowing.

Clinically, HPV is not considered a lifelong infection. That's because we don't really know what happens after this point of immune control. At the moment, it looks like, in some people at least, there may be some fragmentary DNA left in the cells. We also know that for some people, immune control is not strong enough and the virus can reactivate at some point (there is [an uptick in women in their 50s](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3532821/) with positive HPV tests which probably isn't just divorcees getting their freak on). 

We currently don't know much about why this happens and to whom. From the study linked above:

*The questions of why and how low-level persistence happens are not understood. A small focus of infected cells may simply be inadequately sampled, or the HPV load may drop to only a few copies per cell at the time of HPV integration into the host genome, making detection unlikely. The resulting low viral copy number may be below the lower limit of detection of standard HPV PCR assays, resulting in falsely negative HPV testing results. This small focus of cells could persist under immunologic control until waning control later in life allows lesion expansion and subsequent HPV redetection.*

And some more ideas [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3547385/), including the impact of menopause on the immune system.

However, we also know that this doesn't happen to everyone - otherwise we would see more cervical cancer occurring in women in their 70s and 80s.

It also doesn't seem to be something that happens all the time. If most people get HPV in their teens to 20s (i.e. first few years of sex), with frequent recurrence we would expect to see many more positive HPV tests and abnormal smears during the 30s and beyond. The reason smear tests are a good way to catch cancer cases is that they find the persistent cases of HPV that haven't cleared up; frequent recurrences would presumably cloud this data.

We also think that 'recurrence' can, in some cases, be caused by reinfection with the same type. [Men are particularly at risk](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/218/8/1219/5002064) for this:

*As men appear not to develop immunity to HPV following natural infection \[17\], the probability of any given HPV type recurring will likely depend on the prevalence of the individual HPV types circulating in the community, the number of new sexual partners and their current infections, and perhaps the infectivity of the different HPV types.*

In other words, it's all quite complicated. [See here for more details](https://primarycarenotebook.com/simplepage.cfm?ID=x20200815163327349297) of why it's tough to figure out.

I don't know of any studies on warts, by the way, but please post if you know of them. 

But, in short, 'outbreak' isn't really the right word to use here. 

**What does this mean for me?**

Clinically, a reactivated HPV infection is not considered the same as a persistent infection. It can still be controlled by the immune system and doesn't put you at greater risk of cancer (striking out with a link on this, but it's definitely something I have read before). So, not too much to worry about on that front - it just means that, if you have a cervix, you will need to get regular cervical screenings. And this applies to everyone, not just you!

Given that almost everyone will get an HPV infection in their first few years of sex life (and most don't even know), almost everyone has a chance that their HPV could recur. 

See [this paper](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.12.21256547v1.full.pdf):

*The risk of reactivation of an individual HPV infection is likely low; a previous study found redetection after HPV clearance occurred only in 7·7% of infections.  However, the proportion of incident HPV detections due to reactivation in a population may still be high, because population attributable fractions are highly dependent on the prevalence of a risk factor. A low proportion of individuals are likely at risk of transmission due to having a new HPV positive sexual partner at a given point in time, while a large proportion of individuals may be at risk of reactivation of latent HPV infections from past exposures.*

So, on a personal level, there's an argument to be made for **not worrying too much** about this possibility. In the long run, yes, it could happen. But there's not very much you can do about it beyond doing what you are already doing: getting your smear tests, and seeing the dentist regularly. 

**What does this mean for my partner(s)?**

One of the reasons I dislike using the language of HSV when it comes to HPV is that it causes confusion. 

HSV is not actually simple, but it does have some more straightforward guidelines, i.e. don't have sex with a visible outbreak. 

With HPV, the vast majority of the time, nobody is going to know they have an active infection, or if they do, the exact moment that it becomes inactive, so there's no way to really avoid that contagious period. 

But let's say that someone decided not to have sex at all from the time of testing positive via cervical smear to the time of testing negative. Would that actually prevent HPV spreading? For existing partners - no, they probably already have the infection dating from before the first smear. Because smear testing is only done every few years, it's not like it's catching the exact moment of infection. And for new partners - also no. They are likely to have had or have their own strains of HPV. Trying to prevent HPV passing around is like trying to remove grains of sand from the beach.

**What about visible warts?**

If someone has visible warts, it is a slightly different matter, because we know that visible warts are highly contagious (and although I can't see an original paper saying that visible warts are more contagious than a subclinical infection, there are a number of sources that say this e.g. [this one](https://uhs.umich.edu/pap)). Some doctors will recommend to abstain from sex while someone has warts, although an existing partner is likely to share the infection already, so abstaining may not actually be worth it. 

Warts can also be around for a long time. On a personal level, I decided to resume my sex life with visible warts (while disclosing), because it was just too long for me to be celibate. 

Additionally, abstaining until visible warts are removed is no guarantee of not transmitting the infection; when warts are removed, the virus can still be active for some time and it's impossible to know when it is no longer active. PLUS we also don't know how transmissible an inactive infection is (although, logically, one would expect much less or even zero). 

We also don't know if any individual will get visible warts again, or not, or if their partner will (or just be asymptomatic). If someone does get warts again, we also don't know if that's because their original infection just never went away (persistent) or it was partially immune controlled and came back, or it's a new infection. 

So, in short, yes, you can get warts again. Maybe. But then again, so can lots of other people who didn't even know about it! And at the end of the day, there's not very much you can do about it.

**So...not much point in worrying about it.**

Could you get a recurrence of HPV...yes

Could your partner get that strain...yes

Could you get a new strain of HPV from your partner...yes

Could your partner later get a recurrence of HPV that they didn't even know they had...yes

Can you put the toothpaste back in the tube... no...so just live your life as best you can. 

We **all** need to be keeping a non-obsessive eye on our health, keeping up our checks and doing all the things we know are common sense like not smoking, eating more veg, moving our bodies etc.

And, in an ideal world, our partners would be vaccinated to reduce their risks of cancer and warts (and we would be too, because remember they bring their own strains to the party)."	0
"Some people are saying that Dr. Robert Malone is not the real inventor of mRNA technology, and that title goes to Dr. Jon A. Wolff, who is dead not long time ago. Sorry if this sounds like typical tinfoil hat story, but it is sometimes necessary to be skeptical.

Jon Asher Wolff (September 25, 1956-April 17, 2020) was an American geneticist. He was the one to pioneer the mRNA technology, and first one to come up with mRNA vaccine concept.

If this is true, then what is Dr. Malone doing with mRNA technology? Why is he taking credit for someone else's work? What is his real motive? So many questions that need to be answered.

How do we know vaccines won't destroy our immune systems in the long term? Maybe in 10,000 years, we'll all die off because our bodies aren't working, and we've relied on vaccines and medicine forever? Have we ever tested mass vaccination for long term outcome? Or not?	-1

"ASCUS - need reassurance Hi all, I’m here to look for some reassurance and advice. Did my first pap last week and just saw the results this morning and it says ASCUS. For HPV it’s reflex if ASCUS so I assume the results will come out later. 

Was literally freaking out when I first saw the results and did some research on my own. Looks like I need to know my HPV status to understand what’s the next step. Fingers crossed for a negative. 

I’ve never had any abnormal symptoms or anything since i can remember. Went to the women’s wellness check because of slight breast pain then took pap together. Now being very concerned as I do have the family history of cancer (not just my mom also my grandparents). I know without further hpv results and potentially other test I cannot say anything now but still anxious. 

I’m a foreigner and came here for school then work, still under work visa at my 10th year here. This year was really bad because I lost my job first, then was told mom got late stage breast cancer, then was dumped by ex date. But I handled everything well by myself. Got a new job in one month, transferred work visa and started dating a new person recently. But now seeing that ASCUS result and potentially maybe other things makes me very anxious. I also don’t know if there’s anything coming up (like if I got hpv/precancerous symptoms) how can I bring it to my partner. I’m afraid he would freak out and leave me (my ex left because of my work/life/family circumstances as a foreigner). Also can’t tell my parents since my mom has been undergoing cancer treatments for months so don’t want her to worry. 

Anyways I know I rant a lot without even knowing what happened… but thanks for reading it and if you have any suggestions or advice appreciate them."	0
"Learning about this debate of vax or anti Hello, I’m someone who hasn’t really thought much about to vax or not to vax. Covid vaccines are the only ones we’ve taken and now that things have mostly gone the way of the flu we don’t bother taking it as we’ve just never really cared to take a vaccine unless it was a big threat like covid. However I have a relative thats very against vaccines (all not just covid) and this has got me researching just how this all works. So I hope this is a place I can ask questions to get pointed to the right info…

1. It seems the process is this…vaccines go through phase 1-4 testing, which is basically larger and larger samples groups, after a company has experimented with using some sort of compound (typically coming from the targeted virus itself) and found it may invoke an immune response in people. Depending on the findings they progress through the phases after FDA approval at each stage. 

2. Those tests/studies are available for researchers and people in the medical field to read. But they are not available to the general public. 

3. Pharma companies are private owned (private or public but I mean not a government agency) and FDA and CDC are government run. 

4. In order to have tests done a pharma company would pay the FDA for testing for their test results to be reviewed and either approved or denied. 

5. Once approved by the FDA, it is now ready to make for the public. Now its onto the GP. Do GP doctors read trials since they are medical pros and have access to trial data? Or do they just trust the FDA?

So that seems to be the process…is that correct? 

Then onto some of the arguments against taking vaccines that is being said….

1. Pharma companies do not actually have data for trials and have not conducted these trials. So any truth to that? How can I confirm or deny this if I don’t have access. For this argument I hope my GP does have access and has read them before administering vaccines because otherwise its an unfalsifiable claim. 

2. There are studies that link vaccines to autism and many other issues. The irony of both denying ‘studies’ while claiming ‘studies’ but anyway for those of you who might agree, where might I find such study and how would I go about validating one study while invalidating another? As a lay person I feel left to simply google and one thing I was googling was the claim that there is no autism in Amish people groups. Google returned links to claims of this sort and many others also claiming studies done show Amish are actually mostly vaccinated and there indeed is autism and all the other things that vaccines are claimed to cause…however where is the study for me to review? It seems very common to simply claim a study was done with no link or reference to a source we all agree are in fact the studies. 

3. Those are the two main objections other than getting into conflict of interest and how the world is personally conspiring against you and its all tied to following the money! We can leave that alone but it does have the elements of paranoia involved when my relatives start expressing these kind of ideas. 

Hopefully I explained what my ultimate questions are here but if anything, the main question is how does someone like me that has no background professionally or out of interest in medical science go about confirming or denying these various claims? 

Thanks.

"Status on flu vaccine? Hi all, 

Just discovered this stock yesterday. Company looks very promising, only question I have is what happened to the flu vaccine? They reported having a better-than-Fluzone oral vaccine in 2020, did some trial work with Janssen, then, nothing. To me this is a potential red flag that they can't find a partner to continue developing this. Thoughts?"	0
"Reporting a serial dater with HPV I was recently diagnosed with the HPV that causes cancer and I have dysplasia. I had broken up with my bf about 4 months prior.

"A message to pro and anti vaxxers alike who wish to read this. PLEASE READ THE INTRO FIRST!! *INTRO*
FIRSTLY! Let me be very clear about how I start this post. I am in no way shape or form for or against the use of vaccines. I am simply here to learn and decide for myself, not others. I'm also here to discuss this topic with all of you. I am not interested in telling someone they are wrong or right, I am only interested in providing people with information that may allow them to make an informed and conscience decision about how they take care of themselves and others (i.e. parents and children). This post is in no way an anti or pro vaccine post, so please do not treat it as such. I myself am personally neutral on both sides when it comes to the discussion about vaccines and whether or not to vaccinate oneself or ones own children. As such, even though there may be things I agree with and disagree with on both side of the vaccine spectrum, I am not here to preach my opinion to any of you (unless you want my to I guess... lol). I am only here to address a SEVERE problem that we face as a society/community and provide you all with ""one"" source of information that is VERY useful to both pro and anti vaxxers alike.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOW THEN (lol)!!! Staring things off, let me address what this ""problem"" is that I'm referring to. This is isn't a problem of whether or not we are wrong or right in our opinions or actions. This ""problem"" that I am posting about is an issue concerning consumer awareness and consumer decision making, but not from an anti or pro vaccine point of perspective, but rather, from a neutral one. YOU ALONE as an individual must decide for yourself what your point of view is on vaccines. Around nearly every corner I turn in the vaccine community whether it be pro or anti, I consistently find that people simply aren't well informed enough to make educated decisions for themselves regarding what I have mentioned above (they also seem to fight quiet a lot among one another as well, both on opposite sides and on their own sides). If this doesn't apply to you whom are reading this, then please DO NOT take this to an offensive level as that is not what this post is intended for. I am simply stating that within the vaccine community/spectrum there appears (at least by my own perspective) to be more dis-informative/under-educated individuals on the subject of vaccines. What I mean by this is that, while I'm sure there are many people who are fully/adequately educated on these topics and subjects, there are many who lack the proper level of knowledge and understanding about vaccines as a concept/principle as well as a science to be capable of making an educated and conscience decision about whether or not to vaccinate themselves or not and this particular issue really bothers me. As far as I am concerned, I do not hold any ill feeling toward the people who decide to vaccinate or not. It is the individuals choice on whether or not the choose to vaccinate themselves (and/or their children). In no way shape or form do I personally believe that any medical establishment or institution has any right or power whatsoever to force a vaccination mandate/agenda (call it what you will) on its general populace. But let be clear that even though I myself do not vaccinate (or advocate for) under normal circumstances, I am more than happy to accept medical attention/advice if the situation is severe/dire enough (i.e. getting bitten by an animal with rabies). One particular culture/society I actually like (in terms of their policies on vaccinations) is Japan (do your own research on this if your interested). Finally, as far as the ""one"" source I am referring to, it is below. I highly recommend anyone who is interested in it to go check it out.

This link is ""https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/additives.htm""
              Underneath ""reference materials"" is a link to a PDF file 
              containing the ingredients of each vaccine (and should 
              still be up to date as of posting this).
Please give this link a look as it taught me a great deal about vaccines and why certain ingredients are used in vaccines. On the page before the PDF you will also find other useful information as well, if you decided to give it a look.

Wrapping this post up, like I said in the opening statement of my post, I am neutral on the topic of vaccines, so please do not take this post as some kind of ""anti vaxxer propaganda"" or anything of the like. I am only interested in educating people, not tricking them into believe narcissistic, ideological beliefs. If you read all the way to the end of this post then you have my gratitude for being this attentive to my words. Thank you!! :D 

And as a little bonus let me share with an amazing ted talks video that I came across recently (despite being 1.5 years late... lol).

The link is ""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORp3q1Oaezw""

This ted talk blew me away with message it presented and if your interested, I HIGHLY recommend it to you. As Daryl Davis said, ""take the time to sit down and talk with your adversaries, you will learn something from them and they will learn something from you. When enemies are talking they are not fighting, but when the talking ceases, that is when the ground is ripe for violence, so keep the conversation going.""

If i think of anything else to post about I'll update the post, otherwise, thank you for reading.

And tl;dr - EDUCATE YOURSELF!!!"	0
"Rapid Onset of Cervical Health Issues: My Experience with HPV, LEEP, and Laser Ablation Hi! This is my first post here. This sub has been so helpful and is such a great community of people that I wanted to share my story and see if anybody had a similar experience.

I am a 31-year-old female from the Czech Republic, vaccinated with Cervarix when I was 13. I always get my Pap smears yearly and never had a bad one until August 2023. My first abnormal result was ASC-H. My OB-GYN suggested it might be an infection, and he prescribed a vaginal cream, Deflagyn, which is supposed to help with HPV infections. I used Deflagyn for a few months, and in the meantime, I also started to feel a pressure in the cervix area, more like a dull pain, not extremely painful but always present. I then did a repeat Pap smear in February; this time it was a more advanced CINtec Pap smear, which also tests for HPV and is said to be more accurate. This time, the result was HSIL, HPV non 16, 18, so my OB-GYN referred me to a gynecologic oncologist who would perform the LEEP under general anesthesia. I met with the OB-GYN oncologist, and first, he did a colposcopy. He said it is definitely CIN 3 and high-grade lesions and that he would need to do a combination of laser ablation together with LEEP. He told me that we still caught it in a precancerous form but that it would be cancer in less than a year and prepared me for the possibility that they might find a micro cancer invasion in the pathology, which happens sometimes. If that happens, he would discuss the next steps with me.

I just had my surgery yesterday, I feel great, and the feeling of pressure in my cervix is gone.

Did anyone also have such a rapid onset? They say cervical cancer takes many years to develop, but in my case, it would develop in just under two years.

How likely is it that they find a micro cancer invasion, and in case they do, what does it mean? Another surgery?

Did anybody else have the same combination of LEEP and laser ablation? He told me that regular LEEP surgery is 15-20 minutes, but mine was one hour long.

Thank you!

I work for a pharmaceutical company and we started this anti-vax movement. Big pharma always gets the blame for cover ups, and we should. Everyone follows the money, however nobody is following the real money. We make little profit with vaccines and most major pharmaceutical companies don’t even make them. If your child comes down with an illness that is nearly eradicated we net our highest profits from their treatment. Our intention was to sell more drugs and nothing else. Are vaccines safe? We don’t actually care because people blame doctors who always fall in line with whatever it takes to keep from being sued.	-1
"Question Doctors (at least in the US) routinely claim 

1. That stealing a baby's umbilical cord blood is harmless even though studies have shown this to be detrimental, 

2. That circumcision is beneficial even though studies and common sense show that it is detrimental, 

3. That putting newborns on formula without breastmilk is fine even though studies have shown it to be detrimental, and

4. That drugging kids with SSRIs (which is chemicaly identical to meth) is beneficial even though studies have shown it is detrimental. 

What's more is that in all these cases big money interest groups have been exposed for producing junk studies to keep the truth of these matters secret and confusing. 

Considering all of this,

"I guess I'm an anomaly. Small Cell Carcinoma The internet is full of horror stories. Especially with cancers like mine. I want someone to search Small Cell Carcinoma in the sub and not feel like they have a death sentence....So I'm telling my story.

I'm a 35 year old with 3 kids and have been married 10 years.

In Feb I started my period and it never stopped. I went to my primary who blew me off. Told me to go on b/c even though I've had my tubes tied for 7.5 years. I pleaded for a pap and pelvic. It came back abnormal and HPV 16. 

Next, colposcopy with a diagnosis for Small Cell Carcinoma of the Cervix. Second opinion confirmed. The words rare, aggressive, bad prognosis thrown around.

Next, cone biopsy to confirm staging and then my oncologist calls me confused.... Stage 1a1. No mets, no nets, clean margins from the tumor they removed during the cone. He's a research professor, been in the field over 20 years and says he's never seen stage 1a1 and will likely never see it again. He is honest and says he isn't even 100% sure how to treat it without being too aggressive.

I had my open radical hysterectomy 5 days ago and we fully expected to find more cancer and I got the call that my pathology came back CLEAR. I am cancer free. 

I recognize it likely won't be like this forever, but it is right now and hopefully long enough to raise my kids. I have been too scared for the last 8 months to Google anything, especially after losing my mom to cancer the same month my symptoms started... 

I just want everyone to know to focus on YOU and YOUR case. Focus on YOUR controllables, how YOU feel and what you can do and advocate for. 

I still have a long road ahead of me and unfortunately as a lot of us know, this is just beginning of so much healing physically and a mental journey I need to start.

But today, cancer didn't win and I'm so damn grateful for that. "	1

HPV Positive on Cervix Hello, 28F recently had an abnormal Pap smear and tested positive for HPV on my cervix. I’m negative for type 16 and 18, but it’s still a higher risk HPV. I did not have good sex health education so I just need help understanding what that means for a potential partner I’m sexually active with. How does transmission work, does it only happen when skin to skin to my cervix? When there’s warts present? Does the infection act throughout my entire body or only the cervix area? Like is kissing fine? I recently started dating someone and we both don’t understand how this viral infection works with transmission. 	0
"HPV 16 Cleared in a Month (maybe I never had it) Hi all, 

I had made a post previously about finding out I have HPV using an at home test kit and if i should go for an actual pap (first pap ever) and got a lot of supportive comments - https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/s/Z8dxSBesYw

Just wanted to thank you guys and also inform everyone that I did go for an actual pap, and the result came out negative - I don’t have HPV at all now. 

Not sure if the home kit was a false positive or if it got cleared on its own, as I didn’t make any major lifestyle changes. I, however, started taking vitamins again, eating home food more and became regular in the gym (all things I used to do before but wasn’t too regular with it in the last couple of months). 

So if there is anyone like me who is a little scared of getting a pap (for the first time or again).. please don’t be. Please go. It was painless (for me) to a point where I didn’t even realise it was over. Took us longer to discuss what will happen before and after the pap tbh. 

My only piece of advice is - PLEASE TALK TO YOUR NURSES! Mine told me that it is not supposed to hurt AT ALL and if you’re even the slightest bit uncomfortable, SPEAK UP. 

She also said putting your hands under your bum while you’re laying down (such that your hip is slightly elevated) helps - I had not heard/read this before and obviously have no reference point to see if it actually helped; but something for you all to consider or talk about at your next pap. 

Maybe this was a sign from the universe to push me to get my first ever pap because I was ANXIOUS AF. It wasn’t bad at all.. but a lot of it depends on your ability to voice the level of your comfort/discomfort. 

Hope all this helps x "	1

"Negative HPV and clear pap 6 months after LEEP The title says it all. I tested positive for HPV the first time I was ever tested (age 30). Have no idea how long I was infected before that, but it also happened to be my first abnormal pap. After two years of CIN1, I ended up with CIN3 and endocervical gland extension. Had a LEEP, and 6 months later, both my pap and HPV tests are negative. I’m sharing this to offer some hope to others who are afraid. 

I’d also note that this outcome is extremely common and expected with LEEPs. Just following up since I know a lot of folks only see the scary posts.

UPDATE October 2021: Just got my 1-year pap and HPV test results. Both are still negative :) Also, my gynecologist said my cervix visually looks normal- no visual evidence of a LEEP at all. Our bodies are amazing!"	0
"I would like some answers (if possible) to these vaccine questions I'm anti vaccine, I just have questions that I don't see being answered.
First, there has never been a vaccinated Vs completely unvaccinated study. That study should be important to everyone, pro vax or anti vax.

Second, everyone on the News is saying how deadly measles is, but no one has died in 19 years or more to my knowledge in America. I know about the ""measles death"" in 2003 and 2015, but people only thought they had had measles after the post mortem, and both people were already sick. 

Thirdly, when Paul Offit, or someone like him says that vaccines don't cause autism, I just will say that to me, that is a complete lie. There have been 19 studies about the MMR vaccine and autism, three studies about thimersol and MMR and autism, and 6 studies about just thimersol and autism. Now, I don't know about you, but that is wrong on a lot of different levels. For one, all of these studies I just mentioned were funded by the industry which would make money if thimersol and the MMR didn't cause autism. Another disturbing thing about this is that NONE of those studies used a saline placebo! No one can prove that vaccines are safe, or don't cause autism, without a saline placebo. Also, what about the 15 other vaccines that have never been tested for causing autism? You see, you really can't mandate vaccines that have never had a proper safety study. 

I could say much more about why at this present time, I don't trust vaccines, but first I would really appreciate it if you guys could tell me where I'm wrong, or where I'm not getting my facts straight. I would love to be wrong on this, and be able to stop believing thousands of children's lives have been messed up by this product. I am just saying my concerns, and will listen rationally to anything you guys have to say. Thanks!"	-1

I hate that sometimes I have trouble writing or speaking English when I used to be so good at it. I hate how everyone around me seems to have forgotten everything that happened to me. I hate that I have to go back to work and continue doing something I hate because I have to pay bills when all I want to do is travel because I really know now how true the saying is life is short. I hate how so much has been taken away from me at such a young age. I hated it when I got the comment a few weeks ago “she must be on her period” when I don’t even have a fucking period anymore and how much I wish I had. I hate that I will never know how it feels to carry a child. I hate that I will never be able to surprise my partner with a positive pregnancy test. I hate that I’m afraid my relationship with the best man in the whole world will soon be over because I’m still not ready to have sex a year after treatment. I hate how much my knees hurt sometimes. I hate how much my body has changed. I hate how hard it can be for me now sometimes to have sympathy for other people and their problems because it all seems such bullshit in comparison to mine.  I hate that my mother decided to not give me the HPV vaccine when I was a child. I hate that I live in a country where your first pap smear is at 30!!!! years old. I hate that my right upper leg hurts when I lay on it in bed which negatively effects my quality of sleep and they aren’t even sure why. I hate that after my treatment was finished I didn’t receive good aftercare from my hospital. I hate it when people say “wow thank god you still have your hair!”. I hate that I’m not sure if I’m still operating on survivor mode and one day I will completely collapse or if I have truly processed most of it. I hate that there are so many things that I want to do and I just want to truly live and enjoy the life that was given to me but in the end I just never leave my house.

Anyone that can relate? What do you hate about this shit disease? I’m really curious."	0
"Just got my first vax.. and now people won’t come around me for a month! Just got my first dose! I was unfortunately one of the anti-vax people and I AM SO GLAD I GOT TO MAKE THIS CHOICE FOR MYSELF AND OTHERS AROUND ME! 

Instead of reading into propaganda I actually did some research on it and read the science behind the vax! Vaccines have helped us so much in the past, why would I not trust it now?! ANYWAYS!


I have people who won’t come around me cause I “create the variant” LMAO then why come around me ever again then?!?? 

Honestly that upsets me, but you’ll come around me UNVAXED?!??"	1
"What new vaccines are on the horizon? Vaccines are incredible and I'm so happy that each new generation benefits from the further developments in science and medicine to give more immunity to the terrible diseases from the generation before.

It seems like there's a lot of development into mRNA technology, into making vaccines easier for 3rd world countries to administer, and for combinations to increase uptake (i.e. Flu + Covid yearly booster in 1 shot).

What are some new vaccines that are in development?  Are there any new vaccines that you foresee in the next decade that the CDC will recommended to give to everyone?"	1

"Anti-vax rhetoric is convincing me to get a vaccine I'm  a sceptic; no shame in admitting it. I disagree with how many  governments have reacted to this virus, but I see that as a separate issue. I'm also a realist, and the data can't lie. It's getting harder  and harder to deny that vaccines are having a positive effect. Cases are up, but hospitalisations and deaths are lagging way behind  comparatively when we had no vaccinations. I've tried engaging with vaccine-sceptics on this issue and I am so tired of seeing the same old  nonsense talking points:

1. it's a gene therapy (it's objectively not)
2. it's  dangerous (there are side effects, some sadly severe, but the chances  are way, way lower than chances of effects from the virus. I believe  this applies for ALL age groups, though happy to see data to the contrary.)
3. spike  proteins (if they're dangerous, we'll get them from the virus anyway,  so may as well be safer and get the vaccination version)
4. no  long term safety data (we do; vaccines have been in people since June  2020. Vaccine side effects happen within at most 2-3 months post  injection. They don't wait for years down the line. mRNA vaccines have  also been used since 2011 for other treatments in trials.)
5. we're  all going to die of ADE (not shown to happen in coronaviruses and if it  would happen, it would have already started to happen)
6. no  one is actually in hospital (my mother works as an intensive care nurse  and her hospital, during the last peak, was 50% covid patients. In \~20 years of nursing she has never seen anything remotely close to the amount of illness and death.)
7. it's  the mark of the beast/a microchip device/deadly poison that will  activate in five years time (all objectively false and not worth  responding to)

With delta spreading like wildfire and the realisation  (that many of us guessed months ago) that this virus isn't going  anywhere, I'm thinking better safe than sorry. I think I would rather  take my chance with a vaccine than the virus.

Grateful for any discussion."	1
What temperatures kill HPV? I have a question, lets say, someone with hpv cooks your food, their blood/salvia  even bodily fluids like semen gets on the food and they serve you the food? if I heat my food to 400 degrees Fahrenheit   for 5 minutes, would that kill hpv?	0
Finally HPV negative after 8 years ! I can't believe my body finally cleared this virus. This is my first HPV negative pap since 2016. I'm 37 y/o now. I've had abnormal paps from ASCUS to ASC-H throughout the years due to hr hpv. I had a LEEP in 2021 for CIN 3 with clear margins, thankfully but still tested positive for HPV at every 6 month repeat pap. Finally, after all these years, my pap is HPV negative! So few things I think finally helped my body clear the virus; I completed the gardisil vaccine series about a year ago. I'd like to think it helped create an immune response to the active infection.  I started exercising regularly and eating less processed foods and more whole foods. I also started taking vitamin C , D + K2 (low vitamin D on bloodwork) and fish oil. And most importantly, I managed my stress as best as I could this year and prioritized my sleep every night. Hoping my body keeps this virus dormant for a long time. Having a colpo every year and paps every 6 months was becoming mentally exhausting. I do wish I recieved the vaccine when I was a teen but I had no idea what HPV was back then and they definitely didn't talk about a cancer causing STI in sex ed ????? 	1

Hard time to get Hep A vaccinated Hi everyone.

I am flying to Vietnam from Australia in the second weekend of November and I have gotten a number of vaccines: Hep B, one for typhoid and another that is for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis.  I am not sure if I should get another Covid vaccine (I have had four, the last one being in 2022).  I am also considering one against Monkeypox.

I am having a very hard time to find one for Hep A due to shortage in my city.  It seems I can only get it a day or two before I fly to Vietnam.  Would that be an issue? 

TIA"	0
"Why don't we just deny your next entry to a hospital if you refuse to get vaccinated? It's surprisingly common for Americans who didn't get vaccinated but ended up recovering from Covid to STILL REFUSE. If it's ""my choice my body"", why don't we just deny them admission to the hospitial the next time they catch Covid without getting vaccinated?

Isn't that an easier solution than trying to force jabs into their arms if they just refuse? If they refuse vaccines, why don't hospitals refuse helping them? Of course that excludes children under 12 or anyone who physically cannot take the vaccine due to medical reasons. But there are certainly healthy people who are eligible yet flat out refuse."	-1
"The vaccine is disrupting some women’s periods. Does this mean the vaccine affects female fertility? I’m scheduled to get the Pfizer vaccine tomorrow and I’m nervous that this vaccine will impact my fertility. I rang my doctor yesterday so she could clear up any concerns I had about the vaccine, but I wasn’t really reassured. I asked her why some women’s periods were messed up by the vaccine and she said that lots of things disrupt women’s periods. I was hoping for a more clear and detailed answer. I’ve done some research online and I found out that scientists have only begun research on the problems women have been having with their periods, and they haven’t even researched the impact the vaccine has on female fertility. Now I’m freaking out because I only have a few hours to decide whether or not to get the vaccine. 
Here are my concerns about the vaccine: 
1) why is the vaccine affecting peoples menstrual cycle?
2) why are they studying the impact the vaccine has on male fertility, but not female fertility?

So should I wait for more research to come out, or get my vaccine tomorrow?"	-1
"3 Month Post Treatment Scan WAS Good! Posting to celebrate! I was diagnosed this April with HPV 16 related, Stage 3B. Went through interval therapy - 30 EBR sessions with 5 weeks of concurrent Cisplatin and Keytruda, then 4 brachytherapy treatments.  Initial PET showed 2 involved lymph nodes.  Just got my results of my 3-month scan.  No evidence of disease!  Other than some new radiation induced osteoarthritis,  all results normal!!

I know it's really scary, and still vividly remember my first exam and how terrifying it was. There was a wall in the doctor's office with notes from all the survivors and it gave me hope.  If you're just starting thus journey,  have hope!"	1
"Positive Cone Biopsy Experience!! I’ve been hoping and praying for what feels like years that I would be able to make this post. I just got my results from a cold knife cone that I had 2 weeks ago, clear margins and negative ECC! 

The mental, physical and emotional anguish I have felt the last 3 months is unlike anything I have ever experienced so I truly know how you all must feel and want to share positivity since I know how dark these times can be. Especially being around your friends all becoming pregnant and giving birth- it’s so freaking hard to sit through without thinking about the possibility that I may never be able to have a family or thinking that I might not even live long enough. My mom also had endometrial cancer a few years which gave me extreme health anxiety- I started religiously getting pap smears after her situation so this was my worst nightmare. 

I was first diagnosed with HR HPV last year when I turned 30. Got my vaccine and had a colpo/biopsy every 6 months- all came back as lgsil. I barely even knew what hpv meant or even what CIN was so I kept living life like normal. I have always been healthy and active but the last 2 years was probably the most stressful years ever and I definitely wasn’t eating as healthy as usual, working out or taking any vitamins. Fast forward to May of this year when my pap came back as hgsil- I was like huh?! Then my biopsy came back as CIN 3, which is when I went into research mode. Changed my diet completely and started taking vitamins such as athletic greens, mushroom adaptogens, beta carotene/vitamin A, omegas and vitamin D. I quit smoking (weed) and started to drink less too. 

The nurses assistant called me to tell me I had CIN 3 and I need to schedule a LEEP asap. I didn’t even know what a LEEP was and said can I speak to the nurse first?! Her assistant called me the next day to tell she is is going on vacation but will answer all your questions when you come in for a LEEP. LOL no. So I found a gyno that recommended a cone biopsy because they are more accurate and prevent multiple leeps on the future. 

I had my CKC 2 weeks ago. It was honestly a easy process. I was nervous as hell because I have never been under and was scared about what they would find. I remember seeing the massive lights in the OR while moving beds and saying holy shit are those lights, then I passed out lol. I woke up and the first thing I said was “is it over already?” Felt no pain, was in the car to go home within 10 minutes of waking up. Healing has not been bad at all, the worst part for me was the gas pain the next few days, especially the night of. Highly recommend a stool softener!! I got my period on Friday and it seems a little heavier than normal but that’s about it. 

It’s been 13 days of waking up staring at my phone from 8:45am when the doctors office opens until 4:45pm when they close, just praying I didn’t have cancer. Not a minute went by that I didn’t think about this and I kept thinking the worst while trying to hope for the best. My dr called me an hour ago telling me the biopsy did come back as CIN3/carcinoma in situ but margins are clear and the ECC is negative- best possible outcome! Next step is I need 2 more colposcopies every 3 months I think and if those are clear I can go back to my yearly papsmear. 

I can’t reiterate enough the mental anguish this has had on me the last 3 months but know you are not alone. It’s all I thought about. As soon as I got off the phone with my doctor I just started crying, not even just because of relief but because of how this has impacted my life. But I really hope this provides some relief to those going through the same thing ?? I feel like I can finally live again. If I could give one piece of advise it’s to not doom scroll through Reddit lol.

UPDATE: ended up having to go to the ER the day after posting this due to a blood clot ?? I am good now though. If you ever have excessive bleeding go straight to the hospital, preferably one that deliveries babies since general hospitals are not equipped for women ??

12/14/22 UPDATE: had a colposcopy and ECC and everything is normal :)

6/19/23 UPDATE: Currently 12 weeks pregnant so I had to get a Pap smear last week, all normal and HPV is absent!!!"	1
"Worth checking-out: Researcher from Finland finds all sorts of crazy crap in 'empty' vax vials He says about 16% were 'placebo' (saline) and all the others had random viruses to include ebola! Heavy metals, human fetal lung tissue and monkey kidney material were also present as well as all manner of bacteria and other bizarre shit. 

Some Dr. friends of his smuggled used vaccine vials out of clinical settings that had small amounts of product remaining (from all 3 brands) in them- he reports they were all literally different. He also tested influenza ones which were consistent, in that, they all contained what they were supposed to (along with WAY too much aluminum and other dangerous crap- but nowhere near what the Covid ones had in them). 

Perhaps most interesting, this guy reports that the vaccines are 'turning people into 'batteries'"" with increasing, measurable voltage depending on whether they had one or two doses and that this is possibly why some people have been experiencing uncontrollable movements, etc. 

And from there it just goes full-metal-doom...

"I was replying to someone, and I thought I made some useful pointd so I'll post my response here. >yet if you wanted you could actually do research into biology, and disprove all of the vaccine ""propaganda"" yourself with factual, observable evidence.

Unfortunately I'm not going to pursue a career I don't want to pursue, in order to make a change that I could almost make without pursuing it.

The thing is, if I go any work as a biologist, they won't listen to me anyway, we see this with experts like Christopher Exely, Christopher Shaw, James Lyons Wylier, Andrew Zimmerman, Theresa Deisher, jack wolfson, Zhibin Yao, Peter gotzche, Peter Aaby, Lluis Lujan, suzanne humphries, bob sears, andrew wakefield, john walker smith, romain k gherdardi, richard kelly, simon murch, etc.. They all are censored, ignored, vilified, scapegoated, projected, filtered out from mainstream, and slandered. 98% of the time with NO justification whatsoever.

Here's a thought, I considered going to university and college to get a degree in a biology field, so I could enter a pharmaceutical company or government company (CDC, FDA) and then I realized, well, would I get in, even with qualifications? Well, no fucking way. They'd interview me, and if they thought I posed a scientific threat to their company's reputation (say they figured I wasn't going to be easily manipulated, and I was too questioning and critical for their liking) they'd just deny me a job there. Anyone that is critical of big pharma, won't be allowed into big pharma, hence why big pharma is full of people who agree with big pharmas science, because the people who disagreed, weren't allowed in. Filtering is a massive astroturfing technique, it allows big pharma, CDC, FDA, to say ''look all the mainstream scientists say vaccines are good and effective'' when in reality, they ohly allow scientists that would benefit this view, into mainstream science institutes and companies. The critical, free thinking, knowledgeable scientists, are basically forced into a low ranking job, away from power. Isn't that convenient!

>Yet you dont, and there are only two reasons for this that I can think of, you either dont want to do research for fear that you will be proven wrong

I've researched at the highest level I can, with the resources I have available. I don't need a laboratory and an extensive knowledge in pathology to understand basic statistics, history, philosophy, and politics. 

Also, I'd like to stress, that there is absolutely no reason whatsoever that I would like to believe that concurrent and historical vaccine usage is a net negative to the health of the world. I would love to believe anything but this! I'm absolutely horrified by what I find about vaccines. The exact reason I am against vaccines, is because I believe they are KILLING people. I definitely do not want to this to be the case, also because I have literally developed anxiety, panic attacks, heart issues, breathing problems, depression and all kinds of other things, purely due to the sheer stress that this whole vaccine situation has caused me. I absolutely fucking HATE it. I would instantaneously discard my views of vaccines with any good reason to do so. I have yet to find any. 

Why on earth would I want to believe that (I'm not a mother, but say I was) my ACTIONS, had resulted in my child being, KILLED, injured, autistic, or underdeveloped, for very little benefit or none at all?

Why would I WANT TO BELIEVE THAT? Am I going insane? Or am I demonstrably right? 

>and you say that all the research done by credible universities cant ve trusted because ""big pharma"" wont let the truth be let out

I'd say that a large amount of the research is poorly carried out and presented. It's manipulated, selectively carried out, hidden, distorted, magnified, overstated, financially driven, bias driven, understated, cherry picked, and culturally driven. 

I also have no care for appeals to authority or credibility. If they're wrong, they're wrong. I don't care if it's a ''credible university'' or ''top scientists'' I care if it's true or not. 

Here's an example: In denmark, a study was carried out to try and prove mmr vaccines have no autism link. You probably would say this is credible and reasonable, however, it doesn't take an Einstein to figure out that comparing ALL VACCINES with ALL VACCINES - MMR, is not a fair way to determine whether or not MMR causes autism. It's predicated on the mathematical notion that says biology works like a maths equation. When this is false. Biology is not mathematical. You can't compare a body hit by 7 bullets and a body hit by 6 bullets and say that because the amount of blood is the same or almost the same, that there is no significant link between an individual 7th bullet and blood loss, mostly because the body is extremely complicated, and it's not like your body is equally distributed with blood, and it's not like your body reacts to things individually the same as it reacts to things commutativity. They, still haven't, although they have tried to claim they have, done any real comparison of MMR vaccinated, against non vaccinated, with relation to autism. Why? Because they know what they will find if they do a proper study. 

>or you are too lazy to do actual research and only rely information found on social media

I use all kinds of available resources, whether that is google, books, lectures online, documents, talks, documentaries, interviews, testimonies, statistics, doctors, experts ect..

Social media is not a source. Social media is a platform. That is it. 

Calling social media some kind of unreliable source, is like calling paper, unreliable as a source for information. It's the books that I'm looking at, not the paper.

>wich is obviously biased and slanted toward similar opinions and ideologies to yours. So wich is it.

No buddy, you're far far off the reality. Social media is 99% consumed with pro vaccine content, and 1% anti vaccine content. And it's worse than THAT!

Most anti vaccine content is censored, removed and filtered by google and big tech. Don't believe me? There's quite literally campaigns that set out by big media, big tech, and big pharma, to prevent any unfavourable information about vaccines, from being platformed. 

Why do they need to censor us? If the truth is on their side? Why do they need to censor us, if they're not worried about a revolution? 

Why did they wait till 2017-2018 to start censoring us properly? Because the internet has allowed a huge spread of information across the globe, and a mass sharing of stories and studies that wouldn't normally be present together, that has allowed us to see through the dilution of information. 

Maybe you should drop all your preconceived notions, cultural norms, and hopes, and look at the situation critically, and freshly, through a lens of gaining truth, and not through a lens of agreeing with whatever dur scientist man said on corrupt foundations. 

Because I think the only position that can be reached, after an honest and critical examination of vaccinations, is that at the very least, it's a whole lot less pretty and good as it is made out to be by corrupt vaccine makers."	-1

"How much does the tetanus shot hurt? So it turns out I need to get another tetanus shot since the 10 year window policy is up. 

The last time I got my tetanus shot was 10+ yrs ago when I was 11, and even tho my memory is hazy, that shit hurt my arm like a bitch when the needle was being inserted (painful ass stabbing) AND afterward (super sore arm).

So I was wondering how much getting the tetanus shot would hurt when the needle’s being inserted and after since that memory when I was 11 still haunt me to this day lol. 

Just for reference, I’ve gotten the flu + Covid vaccine shot (full + boosters), and they felt more like pricks in my arm which isn’t that bad i guess.
How does the tetanus shot compare to those? 

Also, how does it compare to blood work? Blood work was awful for me: I was wincing in a lot of pain when the needle was being inserted into my arm, and afterward, I started hyperventilating/close to passing out. Not an experience I would ever do again (it’s possible the nurse did a bad job , and also possible I didn’t drink enough water before) lol."	0
"I’m new here and I have questions. When you guys talk about “anti-Vaxxers” are you taking about the moms who refuse to get their kids vaccinated leading to a dangerous and shirt life, or are you talking about the people who don’t want to get the Covid vaccine? I am a person who got the original 2 Covid vaccines, at first it was fine but then later on I started having insane pvc’s which caused me to seek medical treatment to then be diagnosed with IST (irregular sinus tachycardia) which, imo, was from the vaccine and my doctor tends to lean towards that as well, from now on I will not be getting vaccines until it is proven that the negative side effects aren’t as serious or that we know about the long term effects. I do not believe that there are “microchips on the vaccines” or that “people are stupid for getting them” I just don’t feel comfortable taking them myself since of my experiences so far. Do you guys consider me an “Anti-Vaxxer?”

"Please help me gently persuade a persuadable vax-hesitant friend I have a close friend who has not taken the COVID-19 vaccine.  I would like to change her mind about that.  To me this stuff is blindingly obvious -- I took the vaccine the moment it was available to me.  But because it's obvious to me, I may not do a great job in helping her reach the same conclusion, and I don't want to blow the chance.  Shouting ""SCIENCE!"" at her won't get it done; I need to reach her where she is.  

She has on several occasions sent me links from the anti-vax-o-sphere and asked me what I thought.  In fact the current opportunity I have to talk to her about this is based on her sending me the Project Veritas instagram page and asking me about it.  She has asked me, for example, if my arm was magnetic where I was injected because she saw a youtube video where somebody was claiming that forks would stick there.  It is worth pointing out that she doesn't swallow this stuff credulously; she's asking for advice and guidance.  

She voted for Trump, because she liked the way he ""says what he thinks"".  She is not particularly political.  She approaches the world from a new-age/spiritual standpoint rather than a science-based or Christian-based standpoint.  

She is NOT stupid.  She is not mean or petty or unkind or any of those things.  She is misinformed and is a victim of a pernicious misinformation campaign.  She will do the right thing if it can be presented to her properly.

If you had to persuade her, what would you say?"	1

"LLETZ. Hello, I had my LEEP done June 7th CIN2. Luckily I had my results within 2 weeks due to me visiting my doctors office. 

I’ve now received my letter from the nhs hospital. Reads as following,

Following your recent visit to the colposcopy clinic I am writing to inform you that we now have the results from the tissue removed from your cervix. 

The tissue did show evidence of pre-cancerous change (HPV) but nothing more abnormal than this. (PHEWW!!)

As there is a discrepancy in your biopsy results and LLETZ histology, we will discuss your case in our next multidisciplinary meeting next month and will make further management plan, that will be more likely to repeat your smear but we will update you after the meeting which may take upto 6 weeks. 

Does this mean? I will go back to smears and this is over for now could the HPV be gone after the LEEP? I’d like to hear others history after there LLETZ. Thank you."	0

In short, my entire family has become vax-skeptical since COVID, with at least one of my siblings knowingly becoming anti-vax. Here are some things they have said/done to confirm that:

* When they recently had their first child, they refused to have a vitamin K shot administered to their child. I obviously wasn't in the room, but apparently, this caused a huge issue with the doctor. 
* They have sent me messages and ""studies"" that show the harm of metals (mercury, aluminum, etc.) being present in vaccines
* They claim that along with the rise in vaccines, there is a rise in childhood cancer, autism, autoimmune diseases, etc. 
* They essentially claim that natural solutions (herbs, whole foods, etc.) are more effective at treating diseases than vaccines. As an example, their child didn't get the RSV vaccine and was ""fine"" and they pointed at a couple of other kids of friends of theirs who were vaccinated and still had to be sent to the hospital (in reading, RSV vaccinations are about 80% effective in preventing hospitalization, and of course, saying ""look at what happened to this one person"" is anecdotal).
* Any claim I make about ""where are the studies showing these claims?"" is pushed back on and includes a response along the lines of ""Well, where are the studies *disproving* these claims?""

I've reached a point where I don't even want to spend the time trying to find resources to disprove their points, because if I sent something from the CDC, WHO, or any place or person that isn't independent, it's not legitimate in their eyes because these entities are apparently persuaded by other influences and are involved in or ignorant to some grand scheme. And, honestly, I have better things to do with my time.

I think what I'm looking for here is some help on:

* Finding legitimate resources that disprove these claims (harms of vitamin K shot, harm of metals being present in vaccines, any tie to things like autism, cancer, etc.)
* If anyone else has struggled with family who is anti-vax, and how you handled or are handling that
* And, what are the risks of being around an unvaccinated child? Are there risks for me as an adult? I'm also concerned about my future child potentially being around their unvaccinated children.

Honestly, I don't think I can do anything to change them, and am just going to draw a boundary to not have these conversations with them any longer, but there still is the concern about the safety of myself and my future children being around their children.

Thank you in advance for your help."	0
Thinking about the HPV vaccine Okay, so the HPV vaccine hit the doctors offices in 2006, meaning that generations before, such as my parents, grandparents, and so on, never got the vaccine. I have never known a single person with cervical, ovarian, etc cancer, but that's just me. My question is: If the HPV vaccine is super important and prevents cervical cancer (among other cancers in that area), why are older generations completely okay? My mom never got it, and she's fine. My grandmother never got it, and she's fine. And so on.	0
Novovax expiration date Called my local CVS and they said they have Novovax covid vaccines that expire 12/24, are those still safe to take? How long are vaccines good for? Like if these expire this month when are they from probably? 	0
"Heart-Related issues surging among young athletes  I am certain we have all heard of Bronny James' collapse due to cardiac arrest. This incident has become a catalyst for some form of hysteria among anti-vaxxers regarding COVID shots, claiming that these shots are what have been causing a surge in heart-related complications like myocarditis and deep vein thrombosis in many celebrities (Jamie Foxx, D'amar Hamlin, Al Roker, etc). 

My question is if this community agrees or at the very least acknowledges the existence of some connection between the shots and these cases, and if so, what is the likelihood of suffering from these complications years after taking the vaccine?"	0
"A message to pro and anti vaxxers alike who wish to read this. PLEASE READ THE INTRO FIRST!! *INTRO*
FIRSTLY! Let me be very clear about how I start this post. I am in no way shape or form for or against the use of vaccines. I am simply here to learn and decide for myself, not others. I'm also here to discuss this topic with all of you. I am not interested in telling someone they are wrong or right, I am only interested in providing people with information that may allow them to make an informed and conscience decision about how they take care of themselves and others (i.e. parents and children). This post is in no way an anti or pro vaccine post, so please do not treat it as such. I myself am personally neutral on both sides when it comes to the discussion about vaccines and whether or not to vaccinate oneself or ones own children. As such, even though there may be things I agree with and disagree with on both side of the vaccine spectrum, I am not here to preach my opinion to any of you (unless you want my to I guess... lol). I am only here to address a SEVERE problem that we face as a society/community and provide you all with ""one"" source of information that is VERY useful to both pro and anti vaxxers alike.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOW THEN (lol)!!! Staring things off, let me address what this ""problem"" is that I'm referring to. This is isn't a problem of whether or not we are wrong or right in our opinions or actions. This ""problem"" that I am posting about is an issue concerning consumer awareness and consumer decision making, but not from an anti or pro vaccine point of perspective, but rather, from a neutral one. YOU ALONE as an individual must decide for yourself what your point of view is on vaccines. Around nearly every corner I turn in the vaccine community whether it be pro or anti, I consistently find that people simply aren't well informed enough to make educated decisions for themselves regarding what I have mentioned above (they also seem to fight quiet a lot among one another as well, both on opposite sides and on their own sides). If this doesn't apply to you whom are reading this, then please DO NOT take this to an offensive level as that is not what this post is intended for. I am simply stating that within the vaccine community/spectrum there appears (at least by my own perspective) to be more dis-informative/under-educated individuals on the subject of vaccines. What I mean by this is that, while I'm sure there are many people who are fully/adequately educated on these topics and subjects, there are many who lack the proper level of knowledge and understanding about vaccines as a concept/principle as well as a science to be capable of making an educated and conscience decision about whether or not to vaccinate themselves or not and this particular issue really bothers me. As far as I am concerned, I do not hold any ill feeling toward the people who decide to vaccinate or not. It is the individuals choice on whether or not the choose to vaccinate themselves (and/or their children). In no way shape or form do I personally believe that any medical establishment or institution has any right or power whatsoever to force a vaccination mandate/agenda (call it what you will) on its general populace. But let be clear that even though I myself do not vaccinate (or advocate for) under normal circumstances, I am more than happy to accept medical attention/advice if the situation is severe/dire enough (i.e. getting bitten by an animal with rabies). One particular culture/society I actually like (in terms of their policies on vaccinations) is Japan (do your own research on this if your interested). Finally, as far as the ""one"" source I am referring to, it is below. I highly recommend anyone who is interested in it to go check it out.

This link is ""https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/additives.htm""
              Underneath ""reference materials"" is a link to a PDF file 
              containing the ingredients of each vaccine (and should 
              still be up to date as of posting this).
Please give this link a look as it taught me a great deal about vaccines and why certain ingredients are used in vaccines. On the page before the PDF you will also find other useful information as well, if you decided to give it a look.

Wrapping this post up, like I said in the opening statement of my post, I am neutral on the topic of vaccines, so please do not take this post as some kind of ""anti vaxxer propaganda"" or anything of the like. I am only interested in educating people, not tricking them into believe narcissistic, ideological beliefs. If you read all the way to the end of this post then you have my gratitude for being this attentive to my words. Thank you!! :D 

And as a little bonus let me share with an amazing ted talks video that I came across recently (despite being 1.5 years late... lol).

The link is ""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORp3q1Oaezw""

This ted talk blew me away with message it presented and if your interested, I HIGHLY recommend it to you. As Daryl Davis said, ""take the time to sit down and talk with your adversaries, you will learn something from them and they will learn something from you. When enemies are talking they are not fighting, but when the talking ceases, that is when the ground is ripe for violence, so keep the conversation going.""

If i think of anything else to post about I'll update the post, otherwise, thank you for reading.

And tl;dr - EDUCATE YOURSELF!!!"	1
Vaccines are bad As a doctor I'm not supposed to tell you this but vaccines actually put toxins and diseases in your body and we use it as research.	-1
"Changed my stance Hey.  Please encourage me.  I have a 2.5 year old who’s got no vaccines yet.  I’ve decided that decision was dumb and so I’m starting him now.  He will get 1 vaccine every couple months.  Im doing the right thing! Remind me of that!!! 

P.s.  my 5 year old has all CDC vaccines.  I was just worried about adverse reactions the second time around with my younger son."	0
"My girlfriend just told me she has HPV, should I be worried? I've been with my girlfriend for about 6 months, I have known about her sexual history since before we started dating but today she told me she found out she has HPV

She didn't specify which type but not the ""cancer"" type. Still she was my first girlfriend, first kiss everything and I'm high key panicking about having got an STI

Basically am I cooked? Should I be worried? Should I even stay with her?"	0
"Confused by LEEP results Hi there! Before I'll ask my question please consider the following facts about my situation:

F22, no PCOS, endometriosis/other pathology ever detected before

- May 2023. HPV+(51), PAP showed LSIL, colpo also showed CIN1, no biopsy reconmended. 
- November 2023. HPV+(66, no 51, no changing partners). Got my normal PAP but colpo showed CIN2, LEEP recommended.
- November 2023 - December 2023. Freaking out. Super stressed out. Irregular cycle. Constant spotting/bleeding. Doc checked ultrasound, everything was okay so she suggested hormons were freaking out too. 
- January 2024. Finally got my LEEP(I asked for numbing my cervix with an injection so everything was pretty good). 
- late January 2024 aka today. Got results with CIN1 only

so my question is could there be a mistake? 

what if:

1) ...she failed to catch enough cells to check all of them. 'Cause she didn't do a colpo right before the LEEP(like, when actually doing the LEEP)
2) ... the cancerous or CIN-3 cells are hidden deep in cervical canal so we can't know exactly whether I'm clean or not

Am I an overthinker? Yes. But I'd rather check all possible bad results than feel happy because of the false ones. 

I'd appreciate your opinions ladies!"	0
"Arm still very painful a week after tetanus shot I (F28) got bitten by a dog last week and the owner ran off so I went to the ER just in case and they suggested I got up to date with my tetanus shot that same evening. I went home with a minimal bite wound that healed within two days, but the pain from the vaccine shot has been lasting ever since. It initially got better for two days then got suddenly worse and now it's almost stable but I don't feel any improvement. Tomorrow it will have been one week since the shot. 

I have been taking oral ibuprofen twice a day since the shot and it has helped a bit but I don't feel comfortable using ibuprofen every day even if it's not a strong dose....

My primary care physician isn't where I'm currently stationed for work so it's gonna require a trip home for me to see him, which isn't far (2 hours train) but not convenient. 

Should I wait a few more days since it's not been a week yet ? Or is it better to get consulted asap ? I heard there can be injuries resulting from poorly administrated vaccines but I don't know if I'm not jumping the gun since it's not been a full week. My concern is that the pain has gone down then gone way up again. Thanks for your input.

Hpv 16/18? Via handshake Can you get HPV 16/18 with regular contact with random people in the office? Such as handshaking, using public WC etc	0
"Looking for retreats outside of Peru beacuse of being unvaccinated Being unvaccinated against Covid has halted the planning of my Ayahuasca trip. I had narrowed it down to four different centers in Peru and was ready to choose one when I checked the Covid regulations for tourists.

&#x200B;

Some sources say I can enter the country without a vaccine passport but not enter restaurants/hotels/malls. Some say I cant enter the country at all. I emailed the embassy for my country in Peru and they say I need a vaccine pass to even enter.

&#x200B;

So even though I think Peru would be the most authentic place to experience Ayahuasca I now feel compelled to look for retreats in other countries.

&#x200B;

Does any one have any recommendations? Both about different countries but also center recommendations are appreciated."	0
"Can someone simplify the terminology used here please? I’m getting confused… The part about what he found on my cervix. 

I had a random colpo in Jan due to weird symptoms and it was just a precaution measure from my gynaecologist alongside an ultrasound after finding some little cysts. They didn’t expect to find anything but surprise! CIN1 (well she said she saw low and moderate but biopsy confirmed CIN1). I went back few weeks ago as they decided to see me in 6 months given symptoms and this time I had a consultant do the colpo and he saw this and given my previous experience having the biopsy agreed to do it during the hysteroscopy (he asked if he could arrange this just before the colpo to investigate symptoms I have). 

Losing my mind at how fast this has happened as my 2021 smear was clear no HPV. "	-1
"Monkey Pox a new variant… This new Monkey Pox variant that is spread without sexual contact might be something that INO could get into. So now, apparently Monkeypox is spreading among the general population... without sex.

The mortality rates look serious… and I seem to recall INO working with monkey pox somehow.
And now that I've looked... yes, Inovio has been highly successful with a Monkey Pox vaccine. 
So if this news doesn't make it big, then I don't know what else Inovio is waiting for.

"Still sore a week after tetanus shot. 23M
6’1
155 lbs

I had a tetanus shot about 5 days ago and since the initial soreness wore off from the first day I’ve just been experiencing discomfort afterwards. It’s hard to explain exactly what it feels like but it’s still sore and I feel weakness/tiredness in that arm especially when picking things up and overall my shoulder/arm/pec on the side where the injection was is still just tight and stiff overall.

There's nothing visible on the arm itself - no redness, or sign where the actual injection was. No redness or fever either. The pain is up high, about 3 inches below my shoulder. 

I've gone down an internet rabbit hole on all the things that can go wrong from a vaccine injection like this, and of course I'm fearing the worst like SIRVA or Brachial Neuritis. 

Should I just wait it out? Will it go away on its own? Has anyone else experienced this and then recovered with time? Thanks for any advice and input."	0
"Can we at least agree on one thing? Almost all of us, have good intentions, and want what's best for the world, and our children. 
.
So, can we stop saying ""murderer"" to those who you disagree with medically? At least 99% of vaccine critics, and I guarantee this, don't have the slightest I'll intentions, and at least 97% of pro vaxxers don't either. 

We should be able to disagree, without having a war, and being uncivilised and slanderous."	0
