"The vaccine debate is drastically oversimplified by you vax folks. As Ben Goldacre says ""It's a bit more complicated than that"". I'd say that vaccines are one of the most complicated medical topics of discussion, and it's incredibly complex and sometimes requires a counter intuitive perspective, a big picture perspective, and a overall weighing of the benefits and cons. 

It's also a very important and serious debate.

It, depending on the criteria you apply, can be bewilderingly complex to analyse such questions.

I mean, take benefits to cons for example.

How do we create, a criterium of which people can agree on, to determine, for example, how bad autism is, compared to say measles induced deafness?

I say, 3 -> ?? points for autism, and 4 -> ?? point's for deafness. 

Ehh.. well.. I just pulled that from my ass.

On top of this, you have to consider the likeliness of these things, the vast levels of severity of these things, all in conjuncture with thousands of other variables, factors and philosophical questions.

Such as, at the extreme, the butterfly effect, I mean we can go that far..

Or the trivial, the long term to short term  factors. Such as, whether or not con A, is worth it, in the necessary attainment of benefit B in the future.

And when you start to consider all the variables, and chaos of determining and weighing things out, it really says that there is no easy answers.

Is 25,000 dying from vaccines, better than 45,000 dying from diseases?

Well, we can consider this:

What if dying from these diseases, provokes us to change the living conditions, dietal practices, hygienic practices, sanitative practices, social practices (sex), medical practices, educational practices, and many other things, that in turn, would save many more lives over the next 50-years, than would have been, had they been having vaccines instead.

And the same could be asked the other way round, and the same would work for every single thing that is considered..

As you can see, it's not as straight forward as one might think.

I think, the reason it is extended oversimplified, is based on the comfort that everyone has in eating mental chocolate over mental broccoli.

Never presume safety. Science works from a hypothesis, that is set out to be disproved.

Marketing works from a hypothesis, that is set out to be proved, and then put into business.

Vaccines are always presumed safe, and effective, but being reasonablu skeptical, and questionitive (my new word, no idea why it's not already) rarely ever contributes to a bad thing.

Unless of course, you have something to lose?

I wonder what that might be?

Maybe, just maybe, it's that it's a result of jumping to conclusions, that leave you thinking your on a boat above water, and this boat is keeping you from drowning. Don't jump to conclusions, unless you want to be wrong.

Instead, check to see if there's really any water, and if this boat is really the thing holding you up."	-1
"My experience with the Moderna vaccine I’m a healthy, fit 24F healthcare worker in Central CA and I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine for COVID-19 at 1:30PM on 1/12/21. I have never had COVID-19 to my knowledge- I had to have been asymptomatic if I ever did have it.

The first day/evening I simply had a mildly sore arm.

I woke up at 7AM on 1/13/21 and noticed that I was generally achy & fatigued with back & joint pain (I feel this way whenever I’m fighting a virus). I ended up getting chills and a fever of 101.3 in the afternoon of 1/13/21. I monitored my fever and it went down to 100.0 before I took ibuprofen for a migraine that developed around 5PM. I stayed in bed all day, was too weak to do anything else. I really felt like crap.

I am now 47 hours from my first dose and I feel 100% normal. My arm is still slightly sore but it’s barely noticeable. All symptoms & fever are gone so I’m back at work. My coworkers all reported their worst symptoms yesterday (1/13) as well.

I will update when I get my second dose in about a month!

UPDATE 2/10/21: I got my second dose yesterday at 1:30PM and I bled like hell immediately, it dripped almost completely down my bicep but the paramedic held pressure and it was fine. I didn’t feel the vaccine go into my tissue as much as I did with the first dose.

Around 2 hours afterward, I began feeling slightly fatigued then 7 hours after the dose, I got a fever of 101. 

The next morning I woke up fatigued with lower back & knee pain. It initially felt exactly the same as the first dose but as the day went on, I actually had a little more energy and did some chores. I went to the grocery store but my lower back was REALLY killing me by then. I never took anything for the pain, just ate fruits & veggies and drank lots of water.

I’m now feeling totally normal, ready to return to work tomorrow!

So in my case, I had worse side effects after the first dose and lesser side effects after the second dose!"	-1
"I wonder how all the anti vax people who promised that all vaccinated people would die after 5 months think today During Covid19, many anti vax ppl talked in their facebook groups that ""one day all vaccinated people will drop dead because of the vaccine"". Some said we will die after so and so many months, others claimed we all will die when the government is pushing a button or some other ridiculous nonsense. Now, 4 years later, I am still waiting to drop dead. I wonder how those people are thinking about their doomsday prophecy today."	1
New Study!!!! ive done a study and found out, if you dont get vaccines, you are significantly more likely to get autism	1
"Dr Stanley Plotkin said just 2 years ago, that DTaP vaccines are not studied for a link to autism. What in the world are you doing if you're not concerned about this one single fact, deeply? We're constantly told vaccines don't and or can't cause autism. 

We know that only one vaccine has ever been tested for this, and the study in question only looked at one ingredient that no longer exists, and was proven fraudulent and did not include an inert placebo control group.

So why on earth are some not concerned about this?

If you're not concerned about this, there's something fundamentally wrong with you, and you will need a lot of disabusing."	-1
"Is it possible the mRNA Sars-Cov-2 Vaccine to permanently alter DNA? I found a good article to read and I will highlight some key points about the mRNA vaccine I understood:

By importing an RNA into human cells, it forces cells to create a segment of the virus not the entire virus and that part is a spike protein not the entire unique microorganism. Once the spike protein is produced, the immune reaction will generate antibodies that recognize that spike protein. In contrast with traditional vaccines the spike protein is created by the cell inside the body, it is not included with the vaccine itself.

Now RNA can be integrated into the nucleus DNA via reverse transcription. This is already happened via evolution with other integrated retroviruses (ERVs) some of them are involved with reproduction some historic details here

[https://www.scientificeuropean.co.uk/humans-and-viruses-a-brief-history-of-their-complex-relationship-and-implications-for-covid-19/](https://www.scientificeuropean.co.uk/humans-and-viruses-a-brief-history-of-their-complex-relationship-and-implications-for-covid-19/)

Viruses like sars are considered external virus while ERVs are internal because they are already part of the DNA, speaking around a cell context. The point here is that such an integration is possible with something new caused by the mRNA vaccine. Now depending what kind of cell is affected, something unpredictable, the injected substance can create various unforeseen effects, for example when stem cells are implicated or even certain daughter cells.

Now you may think it is a remote possibility, but consider the trillions of cells in humans and vaccines with that potential for the entire planet. That remote possibility is now very likely to happen. All this aside of ""antibody dependent enhancement"" (ADE)

"Disposable speculum I am 1 week post-op from a LEEP procedure to treat CIN lesions, which were identified as CIN 3 in my pathology report. 

My OB wants to take a look at my cervix in 2 weeks to see how it is healing. I bled quite a bit during the procedure ( as per my obgyn) and he had to use stitches and cauterize the area.

I am concerned about the potential of having a metal, reusable speculum from his busy practice introduce bacteria or new strains of HPV into my vagina while I am healing. I read a science article stating that HPV is very resistant and has been found on obgyn office equipment even after disinfection (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26071392/)

I would like to purchase a disposable speculum and take it to my examination in 2 weeks.  Has anyone ever done this? I don't imagine it will go well with my OBGYN.

Thank you for any feedback/thoughts."	0

"What to expect: CIN 2-3/Leep experience 26F in NYC

Abnormal pap: Came back with abnormal pap - ASCUS and hpv+ ( negative for 16/18). Super nerve wracking because no one I knew had experienced this and was pretty unheard of in my social circle. I was just really freaked out at this point because I had no one to talk to about it with because no one I knew had gone through it and I went to the worst possible outcome (which I didn’t have). 

Colposcopy: Had a colposcopy which was nerve wracking and a little painful (more uncomfortable/unpleasant than anything) but super short. After affects we’re mostly fine - cramping for 2 days, a little discomfort/soreness, bloating, needed to wear a pad -> panty liner for 3-4 days. Discharge after is orange from the medication and you will quite literally birth what looks like a piece of chicken skin. “Coffee grounds” residue will last for ~4-5 days and maybe a little blood.  I got my results after 4 days and my body was back to normal by 1.5-2 weeks. Biopsy results came back with some high grade precancerous changes (CIN 2-3). My doctor recommended treating this with a Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) to remove the abnormal cells. 

Pre procedure post colposcopy results: At this point I went down a deep Reddit/TikTok hole and while it will give you some good points it can take a heavy mental toll so I want to share with you what this was really like and how to approach it from my perspective. 1. If you do not have a therapist, I highly recommend finding one. Going through this process alone is really scary, but having someone to listen to your fears and give you advice on how to advocate for yourself who is so important for me and my experience. I am a huge wimp when it comes to needles/medicine/blood and I’m also a hypochondriac. So needles and burning off a piece of my cervix? This procedure was my nightmare in my mind however, it was so manageable. 

Procedure: My doctor prescribed me 10mg of Valium to take two hours before the procedure. In retrospect, I wish I had taken it one hour in advance. The worst part of the entire experience is the stress that you will feel because of your mind. I decided to get the updated Gardasil shot because it will account for more strains than the one that I had previously had and my doctor recommended this. The shots hurt, but totally bearable. Next she asked me to undress from the waist down and again I was left to wait. The waiting is when you get in your head so I brought headphones and I made a playlist that had a lot of music that I find calming or distracting. The nurse came back and put this electrical tape pad on my leg so I didn’t get it electrocuted when they did the procedure and then my doctor came in and spoke me through what she was going to do. This is my number one piece of advice for the rest of your experience: put in noise canceling AirPods, and blast music and stare at the ceiling or close your eyes. I had something I was fidgeting with in my hands, and I tried my best to not clench my legs/pelvic too much because I was nervous. She started by removing my IUD to avoid clipping the string which was by far the most uncomfortable part of the entire experience. Take that in, IUD removal was more uncomfortable than leep. She then give me the lidocaine shots to numb my cervix. The shots were uncomfortable - 1 definitely hurt/made me gasp but all of 2 seconds later I had forgotten about it, both shots are very quick. I had read about others hearts racing but I didn’t experience this at all.  The leep machine makes noise but I just focused on my music and the entire procedure from IUD removal to lidocaine shots/leep took a total of 20 minutes. My doctor talked to me a little bit about the end about what to expect, and then I sat for 10 minutes because I tend to pass out. I brought a Gatorade and a pack of shortbread cookies with chocolate and caramel, and I ate those after and drank the entire Gatorade. It’s really common for me to pass out (I did after my IUD insertion) and I really think that this made a huge difference for me. I took two Motrin and then I got dressed and talked with the nurse while I sat. She showed me the piece of my cervix that they cut off which was kind of disgusting so if you get queasy I wouldn’t recommend. It was interesting to see what the healthy areas of the cervix looked like compared to the area with the CIN2-3 (basically the healthy is pink and the abnormal areas were tan/White). Then I went home

Night after procedure: I did cramp starting almost immediately afterwards, but they weren’t terrible cramps. I think my period cramps are worse. I was definitely emotionally drained, but I was fully walking around and wasn’t particularly uncomfortable. I fell asleep around 8 PM and I woke up the next day around 12 PM, which was no issue because I took the two days following it off from work. I recommend getting two good heating pads because afterwards my lower back hurt and I was cramping so I had a heating pad on both areas which was really nice and relaxing. 

Day after procedure: The following day I felt relatively fine - I felt drained emotionally, a little bloated, a little crampy, but no real bleeding/discharge. FYI, I was really scared to use the bathroom afterwards, peeing was no issue and making a bowel movement was fine because I had to go with minimal pushing (I take magnesium at night which helps with this). I started taking Salic acid pills because my doctor told me that this can help and I’m going to prioritize, drinking a lot of water and eating a lot of vegetables. I will update as the first week goes on/as I get my results back but I just wanted to share that this is not a scary of a procedure as you may think so don’t let your mind to get the best of you. You got this girl ??

Update:
No 10/10 pain from procedure - some minor cramping, lower back pains, and bloating through 1 week after. No real bleeding - panty liners were enough but pad the first few days just to be safe By 4 sleeps after the procedure the suture fell out. It was pretty big and I was hungover and grossed out but honestly it was more comfortable once it did fall out. 7 days and still waiting for results - once I have I’ll start to work out outside of walking. By day 7 I felt like I was having more regular discharge"	0

Spacing Out Vaccine Does In Canada they are spacing out vaccines by months rather than weeks in order to give more people one shot to increase immunity.  I have a feeling in a few months researchers will say people don't need two doses.   It just seems strange that so many people getting their 2nd Moderna and Pfizer shots get  pretty sick.   Most vaccines don't require such a robust immune response to work.    Does anyone know what the efficacy of one dose is after 1-2 months?  If it is 70-80%, that is good enough for me.  I am also curious to know if severe covid is less likely after one dose.	-1

Hi guys it’s me again just thinking out loud. I am really so mad at myself. My youngest son is 10 1/2. After I had him I went in to get my birth control (iud). I can remember having abnormal paps since forever but nothing ever came from them. Fast forward to this year I finally got some insurance and  went in to get my iud changed and a pap since it had been a decade.  I was upset it had been so long but being checked for precancerous cells or cancer was never on my mind. I just thought oh I just might get pregnant or my iud could have moved. My pap was abnormal and I was told I had hpv 16 and another high risk hpv but with no number. My colposcopy results showed cin3 in multiple areas and ais in another. I have my cone in 17 days and I can’t help but feel like it’s going to be invasive, especially with the time frame that I hadn’t gotten checked. I feel so stupid for not putting myself first and staying on top of my health care and that if I do have cancer I have nobody to blame but myself :(	-1

"Child dies from measles in Ontario Canada after- first death in over a decade [https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/a-young-child-in-ontario-has-died-of-measles/article\_3f5e6e14-13d1-11ef-bef6-2b5f14b1ee24.html](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/a-young-child-in-ontario-has-died-of-measles/article_3f5e6e14-13d1-11ef-bef6-2b5f14b1ee24.html)

>So far this year, five children aged nine and under in Ontario have been hospitalized with a measles infection, all of whom were unimmunized. One of these five children has recently died of the infection, the report shows.

  
I remember during the pandemic, when they rolled out the covid vaccines for all healthy children, I had said this would be a counterproductive move: how does it meet the risk/benefit analysis for young healthy children?

This was the available data for covid severity in children in Ontario Canada at the time the covid vaccines were mass rolled out for all healthy children:

[https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/epi/2020/05/covid-19-epi-infection-children.pdf](https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/epi/2020/05/covid-19-epi-infection-children.pdf)

Refer to page 12.

Other data from around the world at that time had showed that perhaps (assuming the vaccines would not cause any long term/low grade damage) children 0-5 may benefit from the vaccine. But covid severity was virtually non existant in healthy 5-17 year olds.

  
If you check the link above: in the age 4-17 range, 29 children went to ICU (aka got severe covid) out of 58 943 infections in that age group. Also, the data does not specify, but it is plausible to expect that most, perhaps all, of those 29, were not healthy/had comorbidities or at least were obese. 

So severe covid was known to be virtually nonexistant for healthy children around 5 to 18. Yet when I mentioned this, and I put that link above (which literally comes from the Ontario government), and said can we show how the vaccines meet the risk-benefit profile for this specific demographic? I was censored for spreading ""misinformation"". It is quite bizarre that the same people who post the data censor those who post their own data. Very bizarre. 

I had warned that when you go against basic math and logic, and force people to mass vaccinate their healthy children with those kinds of low severe covid rates, this would, according to common sense and basic logic, would do more harm than good: it would unnecessarily decrease trust, then once trust goes, people would turn to conspiracies, and things like refusing to vaccinate for actually dangerous pathogens such as measles would happen. And this exactly happened. They can't say they weren't warned. They can't say they made a mistake. Anyone can make a mistake, but when you A) make a bizarre mistake that equals to stating 1+1+3, then you are clearly incompetent, and if you stay in your role and refuse to step down, then you should face the consequences of your actions B) I literally warned them, and they censored me. So based on A and B, there is clearly mens rea, and actus reus: in a sane world, those who pushed the covid vaccines for demographics for which they had no data proving (or common sense pointing to) that the benefits outweigh the risk, should be charged with manslaughter any time any child dies from something like measles due to being unvaccinated. 

But they bizarrely double down:

>“It’s awful to see something like this,” said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases specialist at Toronto General Hospital. “It’s a stark reminder that there are still vaccine-preventable illnesses that can be devastating, not just in other parts of the world, but also here in Canada.”

Huh? Weren't you guys were the one who pushed the covid vaccines on healthy children, and were warned this would backfire and cause deaths via lack of trust leading to lowered vaccination rates against diseases that the vaccine actually does meet the risk-benefit analysis. And that is unsurprisingly what happened. From the same article: this is the first measles death in Ontario in over a decade: it is not just a coincidence. It came after the pandemic. It was due to the covid vaccine campaign for young healthy children (even those who had natural immunity). And yet they are still doubling down and calling for perpetual covid boosters for healthy children who already have immunity through multiple doses + multiple infections.

Again, it is not a coincidence:

>The provincewide immunization coverage estimate for [measles](https://www.thestar.com/news/measles/) among seven-year-olds was at 60 per cent for the 2022-23 school year — about the same as the previous year and down from about 85 per cent in 2019-20.

"My husband is antivax, help me argue with him. My husband (27), would rather catch the virus for immunity than take the vaccine to protect other people. I’ll list his arguments below, please help give me points to refute him.

1. The governments of the world has had a history of lying or disproportionately creating scandals for ulterior motives ie Vietnam (which is true, but I argue that at this point the vaccines are bought, bug pharma is already rich, the only question is are the vaccines going to be used now for a small bit of good or not)

2. The “cost” of not taking the vaccine is extremely low. Death rates globally are equal to other common easily avoidable disasters such as driving the speed limit. “The flu kills more people every year, but you don’t take that vaccine yearly”. If the risk to himself or others were higher, he’d take it. 

EDIT: I misspoke here, the flu does not kill more people, this is false and he’s never said this. He says that the flu also kills a large amount of people every year, yet we are not taking a vaccine for that every 6 months, so why should he for covid, as the current vaccine will not be able to keep up with the new variant in 6 months anyway?

3. In Germany, they lied about the hospitals being full. I remind him the rest of the world isn’t so lucky. He disagrees but can’t provide proof.

And more. I’ll reply to the comments with what he might say back.

He is a good man, which is why it is hurting me that he believes this. Is he right? Or can anybody refute him in a way that even he can’t disagree? Please help."	1

"LEEP success story, HPV negative after a decade Hi all, I've been reading this sub for a while and during difficult times it helped me a lot to read some of your success stories. For that reason, I wanted to share my positive outcomes for anyone needing encouragement. I'm 35, I had a LEEP procedure earlier this year and just got my six month results back: normal and HPV negative. No words can describe the relief.

I've had HPV for at least the past 10 years, that's when I was first tested for it. HPV 12 or other, not 16/18. I had low grade abnormalities on and off since 2017 but was always told not to worry as most women clear this on their own. I gave birth (first baby) February of this year, after which my OB told me a lot of women clear CIN at childbirth. Well as it happens to a lot of us in the same boat, the ""most women"" rule did not apply here either. My 8 week postpartum pap smear came back abnormal with high grade changes this time, ""at least CIN2"" in the endocervix on the ECC. Unfortunately, and this is Kaiser in California, I didn't get answers for a long time. Eventually I had a call with my OB who said my results are ""unusual"" and that they can't rule out cancer. She said they sent out the results by error, I wasn't supposed to see them. They do a phone call for bad news like this.. This was a lot on my mental health given how early postpartum I was, too. I struggled to keep my milk supply going and it was hard to focus on bonding with my baby, because of the constant anxiety.

Fast forward a couple of weeks when I finally managed to get an appointment for a colposcopy and got its results back, it was CIN 1-2. Something they told me on the spot and I didn't realize before, even though I had countless colposcopies before, is that they don't biopsy the endocervix, the colposcopy is done on the outside only. So basically, this wasn't going to get us any closer to understanding the ECC reaults. The colposcopy was actually a waste of time, the doctor who told me to get it likely misread my results. They advised a LEEP at this point, given the ECC results.

I had my LEEP in May, didn't go under and it was pretty quick. The lidocaine shots were awful but the rest was fine. The doctor removed a good amount but not too much as I said I'll likely want to have more kids in the future. He mentioned after the procedure that he was hoping to get even more from the endocervix but my cervix is tiny (??) so he wasn't able to get as much without risk of injuring surrounding tissue. I was sad to go home without at least some encouragement from the doctor. Results came back a week or so after and it was very surprising. Endocervix tissue came back entirely clean, the outside on the other hand was CIN 2-3. So basically, both the ECC and the colposcopy were wrong but combined they were sort of right. They concluded clear margins even though the outside slice had CIN on the edge, because the adjoining endocervix tissue taken was clean.

Between the LEEP and today I haven't done anything differently than before in terms of lifestyle. If anything, sleep has been quite bad with a baby at home. I already ate healthy (mostly plant-based, too) and exercised moderately though never enough. However, I read a study after my LEEP where they concluded that getting the HPV vaccine after LEEP within a certain amount of weeks helped some people clear it, so I thought why not. I had the first shot pre-pregnancy in 2023 and took the next one about two weeks after LEEP, last one just recently.

I'm grateful for my results, but the amount of anxiety they put me through was truly unnecessary. All I needed to hear is just one ""you'll be fine"", but I didn't get it from any of the staff at my provider. I was already in therapy due to my traumatic birth experience and in hopes of avoiding PPD, so that helped a lot to be able to talk about it with someone. High recommend.

"My Dear Vaccinated Friends: You will still get it and still transmit it. Your immunity will be inferior to that of the unvaxxed that have had covid. You'll need a booster every 6 months for life. At best you get reduced symptoms for a short time. Be mad at those that lied to you - not the unvaxxed! Additionally, your vaccinated body is forcing the virus to promote variants that will circumvent current vaccines and will promote others to evade future vaccines. 

Everything that is unflattering to the vaccination campaign regarding vaccine failure and vaccine side effect / death is being downplayed or hidden from you. Scientific discoveries regarding vaccine-related problems will not reach you as they are squashed by social media and the medical community. Dissenting voices are silenced directly or due to fear of losing a job or being shunned by society. Other medications that might save the world are being suppressed to keep the ""all must vax"" narrative alive, and maybe also for pharma profits. Politically, the administration can not afford to be seen as doing nothing, so they will promote vaccination - even if it's the wrong course of action. It may be impossible to stop since to admit that they were wrong would be a catastrophe for them - but to continue will be a catastrophe for us.

Down the road you will realized you've been lied to -- perhaps with the best intentions, or perhaps not; but lied to just the same. The only question is what will ""down the road"" look like by the time we get there? In the front of everyone's mind is the virus, but in the back, consciously or subconsciously, this is also about ""owning the political opposition."" Please let go of that, do the research, follow the data, and see where this is heading before it's too late."	-1
"Bivalent Covid Vaccines for the fall: Are they testing on kids 0-5 as well? If I recall correctly, they're running tests on bivalent Original-Omicron and/or Delta-Omicron vaccines that should be ready by the fall.

That's great for most of us, but does anyone know if they're simultaneously trying them on kids in the 0-5 age range?

I am really, really upset the original vaccine is taking so long and I'm cringing to think that each subsequent version is going to lag 18 months behind what the general population can access."	1
"Do my symptoms align with HPV/Cervical Cancer or something else? I just got back an abnormal Pap smear. HPV DNA High risk and LSIL detected. Overall not the worst results, but as I’m doing more research I’m getting incredibly nervous. I’ve had all of these horrible Gyno symptoms, that after a bunch of test come no answers. But now I’m worried it’s either all connected or I still have no answers. 

My mother had cervical cancer at 19, and these symptoms started for me at 19 too but now I’m 26. I know there’s no genetic connection, but it’s an intense coincidence. 

I have excruciating menstrual cycles. I have pain that comes from my right ovary, and it goes straight to my back and down my leg. Causing numbness and just over all misery. It also creates a fullness and intense pressure in my pelvis. At first I didn’t realize it came with my cycle, because of the birth control I was on I wasn’t bleeding. But once a month I was in all this pain. I was being treated for fibromyalgia and lupus because of how bad it was. But now that I know it’s gyno related I still have no answers. Could Cancer be the reason? I have a colposcopy scheduled but I’m really suffering in my own brain about it. 

There are some other symptoms like BV and Yeast infections, but this pain is my biggest concern. "	0

"its funny how you guys dont even see this happening  

you know whats funny about antivaxers? (and other conspiracy theorists) how every single one of you has a different story on how exactly vaccines are bad.   
some say its just the covid ones, some say its just mRNA, some say its all of them.  
some say it gives more worse effects than advertised, some say it gives autism, some say it straight up kills you.

some say is to make more people sick and get money, some say is to lower population.  
and so on and so on...

and thats because you have no real evidence for anything, you just want to believe you are the hero in the story so you eat up whatever conspiracy theory you hear, and you all do that but from a different preacher ending up with a different conspiracy.

on the other hand, the people that actually understand how vaccines work, we tell you the same thing (over and over) because its simply the truth...

"Just found out my cancer is back after 6 months. Looking for advice/support (31 y/o) Hi everyone, I found out mid-May 2023 that I had stage 1B2 adenocarcinoma cervical cancer caused by HPV-16 (despite having gotten the guardasil vax) and had a radical hysterectomy in late June. They removed the top 2 cm of my vaginal canal, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and surrounding lymph nodes. The lymph nodes and all margins were clear so my doctor said that I wouldn't need any further chemo/radiation treatment. I have a big scar down my lower stomach but it felt like a small price to pay to get this super aggressive cancer out of me (I grew a sizeable tumor in my vaginal canal in under a year). My last exam (visual + pap) was in late August where my oncologist said that everything looked good and I was healing well. 

Fast forward to Dec 22nd, I was having ""relations"" with my partner and noticed a *lot* of blood and then saw that a small mass had come out of me that was the size of a few quarters stacked on top of each other. My stomach sank and I immediately called my oncologist, who told me to freeze the tissue and bring it in and scheduled an exam on the 26th. At the appointment she looked inside me and said that, aside from a tiny 1mm red spot, everything looked perfectly normal and she even made sure to triple check that I was certain that the mass came from my vagina (the answer is unequivocally yes). She sent the tissue in for examination but said that hopefully it was just some granular tissue that had formed and then broken off. I hoped beyond all hope that that was the case, too. 

Yesterday morning I got the dreaded phone call. The mass was indeed cancerous and I now have to come in for a more intensive exam/biopsy under twilight anesthesia, and then get a new PET scan ASAP. I'm just in shock that between the end of August and the end of December my body grew an entire new tumor that was the size of 3 quarters stacked on top of each other (inch wide, quarter inch thick), *and* that the cancer somehow spread to my vaginal canal even when all of the surgical margins were clear. 

She has already said that the method of treatment would likely have to be radiation/chemo, which would make my ovaries non-functional just because they're in the line of fire. I'm just in shock. I spent the entire day yesterday just alternating between crying and feeling frozen and numb. On top of this, my original diagnosis came the week after I'd gotten laid off from my job, and I haven't been able to find full-time employment since (not for lack of trying, just not many openings in my field at the moment), and it's been hard affording food + rent + utilities + covered CA insurance premiums. I already applied for financial aid through the hospital I got treatment at last year, but it's going to run out soon and I've had to start over on my out-of-pocket insurance costs because it's a new calendar year. I never started any kind of go fund me the first time around because I didn't feel ""deserving"" of it since it was supposedly an ""easy solve"" with surgery, and now I've noticed some people who had my back the first time around are having an ""ugh, this again? Do you have to keep talking about this?"" reaction, which just makes me feel even more alone. 

I was *so ready* to get back on my feet in the new year, and it feels like I got knocked right back down into ""fight for my life"" mode where I have to put everything on hold to try to not die... again. I have heard of all of the negative possible side effects of going through menopause so young (I'll be 32 in a few weeks) and I'm also really scared about the side effects and possible secondary cancers I might get from having to go through radiation and chemo, especially in my early 30s. I wasn't prepared to have to ""be strong"" all over again so soon. I don't want to die, but I haven't even really been able to regain the mental strength to face this again, and it's likely going to be an even bigger battle than before. 

If you're reading this and have some experience or know anyone who does, or if you know of any resources/support groups you might be able to point me to (especially in the Los Angeles area), I'd be so so appreciative for your advice/help. Thank you for reading <3

TL;DR: Grew a new tumor in my vaginal canal in only 4 months after a radical hysterectomy w/clear margins and now will need radiation. Looking for emotional (and possibly financial) support/resources.

**Update 1/26/24** Both the biopsy and PET scan came back clear, which is great news because it means it hasn't spread anywhere new, but the tumor was still 100% cancer so my cancer may just be hard to detect and so I'll be going through radiation and brachytherapy to hopefully kill anything that's still lingering behind."	-1
"need help :after leep ,hpv+ and how to get pregnancy!!! In 2017 it was found out that I have hpv infection and CIN-III (high grade precancerous), after that I had leep surgery ,and since then I have been tested for tnt, hpv, biopsy etc till now and the results show that it has always been normal and negative for HPV.

I am now planning to get pregnant but I am not sure if it is possible to get pregnant normally? (meaning through normal intercourse) or do I need a special method to get pregnant? (say IUI or IVF for example?). Because I don't want to cause health problems to my husband (because although HPV is negative after leep surgery, the virus doesn't go away completely and can still come back when our immunity is low). My husband is very healthy and doesn't have any infections, so I don't want to put him at risk, but we need to have a baby now.

Thank you all so much for your help."	1

"More Vaccines = More Autism The reason for the rapid rise of autism in the United States that began  in the 1990s is a mystery. Although individuals probably have a genetic  predisposition to develop autism, researchers suspect that one or more  environmental triggers are also needed. 

**One of those triggers might be the battery of vaccinations that young children receive.** 

Using regression analysis and controlling for family income and ethnicity, the relationship between the proportion of children who received the  recommended vaccines by age 2 years and the prevalence of autism (AUT) or speech or language impairment (SLI) in each U.S. state from 2001 and 2007 was determined. A positive and statistically significant  relationship was found: 

**The higher the proportion of children receiving recommended vaccinations, the higher was the prevalence of autism or SLI.**

A  1% increase in vaccination was associated with an additional 680  children having AUT or SLI. 

Neither parental behavior nor access to care affected the results, since vaccination proportions were not significantly related (statistically) to any other disability or to the number of pediatricians in a U.S. state. 

The results suggest that although mercury has been removed from many vaccines, other culprits may link vaccines to autism. Further study into the relationship between vaccines and autism is warranted.

"My family got covid twice, but my parents are still not convinced that the benefits outweigh the risks I'm posting this on behalf of a close friend. From now on, ""I"" and ""my"" will refer to my friend.

I'm 17, living in Mississippi. My parents are very skeptical about the vaccine. They aren't pro-qanon or conspiracy theorists, but rather skeptical about safety because covid-19 vaccines were developed in only a year, the long term effects are unknown, and that mRNA vaccines are a new thing. However, they are convinced that covid vaccines increase the risk of HIV, liver damage, etc.

We all got COVID in November 2020. There wasn't really much we could do, we wore masks when in public places, but the curve was rising.

Now, fast forward to July 2021. This was during the delta variant surge. My older sister got vaccinated and my parents got kind of mad, but they later forgave her since she's 20. We all tested positive, except my sister who lives with us. My mom who is a former smoker, had difficulty breathing and had to go to the hospital. She's fine now, but I don't remember how much, but the bill was expensive. But, the fact that my sister didn't get covid barely helped convince my parents that vaccines work.

Mississippi isn't very great with vaccination rates or masking preference.

Is there some way I can get vaccinated without parental consent and without having to wait until I'm 18 (my birthday is in December)? Also, if so, is there some way I can pay without going through insurance (even if it requires paying out of pocket) since I don't want my parents finding out?"	1

"Kissing amd HPV Hello everyone,

So as the title suggests this is about kissing and HPV. Ever since being diagnosed 2 years ago with HR HPV I've (40F) been doing lots of research. I'm painfully single and I just wanted to do more research in case that ever changed while I'm still positive. To me this was the equivalent of a death sentence since I already have a lot of issues trying to date. 

I already figured that I'd be turned down for sex due to this, but I've been reading that even deep kissing poses a risk. I'm demisexual so I need the emotional connection anyways, but knowing I can't even do something as simple as kissing in the meantime really hurts.

What do you guys do? Have you guys been told by your doctors to avoid it?"	0

Pfizer vaccine induced tissue problems. Hopefully an appropriate place for this question, I received my second pfizer shot in late may.

With lots of back and forth and months of recovery which included re-tearing my pec in September, I finally was in a good place with my training and now I've suffered some sort of forearm injury I'm presuming muscular I'll be consulting my GP to perhaps get an MRI. I've also been afflicted with increased tendon discomfort over baseline from previous conditions and what I can only assume to be systemic fasciitis causing discomfort and sticky friction in several muscle bellies. Bit of a long read but I had previously seen an article and vaccine induced myositis in a woman and I believe some other cases of myocarditis and perhaps eosinophilic fasciitis. Would any of you have any knowledge on any studies indicating any side effects that would cause the problems I'm having? Google is proving insufficient in finding any results perhaps due to poor search criteria on my part, Thanks.	0

"How I cleared my genital warts!!! Hey, so as the title say, this is just me sharing my journey with genital warts. I hate those with my whole life and I hope this post could help some of you.

This is a long read of my experience, treatments, and tips but I hope it would help!

**Backstory: How I Got It**

I first contracted it after dating my first boyfriend who was my first sexual experience. I know, it was the worst as he's my only sexual partner and I thought my life was over. I thought, that was the first and last person I’ll ever have sex with now that I have contracted such virus. I can’t believe my sexual life was over at 25.

My journey started 3 years ago, from March to September of the same year.

 

**Symptoms**

I was showering one day when I felt a small lump down there. My previous partner was promiscuous so I am paranoid with STIs.

When I first saw it in the mirror, my mind went blank. I know it’s some sort of STI, I just don’t know what it is. A little google image search told me what it was.

Throughout my treatment, it grew to more lumps. I would say it grew to almost 30-35 small lumps. Some are flat, some are not.



**Doctors I've Visited**

Throughout my journey, I experimented with various treatments, I went to different OB Gynes, and Dermatologists, and doctors that were specializing with STIs. Lol my savings literally went negative.

**Doctor 1 – OB GYNE:** Told me it’s sexually transmitted, that I should have my partner checked as well. (We’re not together anymore for almost a year when my symptoms arrived, and I was celibate the whole time)

She told me we could do Cauterization or she could prescribe an Imiquimod (Aldara).

I went for Cauterization since the results promised were instant.

Now this doctor used a machine used for treating warts on face. It was small and I couldn’t feel anything almost. After the procedure, she informed me that she can’t take out all of them and that the remaining flat warts will be gone by Aldara. I was skeptical, and I was right!

It did not go after weeks on being on Aldara. It ruined my skin plus the lumps did not stop growing! So now, it felt like I just threw the money I paid for cauterization.

 

**Doctor 2 – Dermatologist**: This doctor was very knowledgeable. He has explained that the virus lives underneath the skin. So even if it’s not visibly there, it could still be there waiting to be reactivated. He also prescribed to drink Zinc daily and Zinc Oxide ointment, prefaced it that it’s a long long longgg shot but everything’s worth the try at this point.

From his hospital, he has referred me to another OB GYNE so I could get cauterized again, which I refused to be treated by, because she was asking for too much money for it and said that she couldn’t guarantee she could remove everything.

My dermatologist also discouraged the act of shaving my genitals before the procedure. And the OB insisted this will be done before the procedure.

In this hospital, it costs my life to have the cauterization procedure (lol almost I guess). So I did not push through with it.

What me and my derma went through instead was TCA. This only worked on the bigger warts. But still, nothing. As long as there’s a wart, they would always grow.

 

After this, I’m just so done with everyone and so I went to a small NGO clinic that specializes in STIs

 

**Doctor 3 – Im not sure what he specializes in (i think it was therapy)**: We talked, and he have explained again how warts could be contracted, and all the educational stuff.

He then proceeded with cauterization that lasted almost 2 hours. (I’ve also paid for almost a quarter of the OB’s rate). He removed every single wart, and I was bleeding on the way home.

I’ve used a sanitary pad for a few days until the bleeding is gone. The warts were all gone, and I was advised to come back after 2 weeks to check the progress. I also took antibiotics to help with the wounds.

 

**Treatments/Vitamins I’ve done**

* Zinc – Took this twice a day. Supposedly for 3 months but got so discouraged, I roughly finished 2 months
* Zinc Oxide ointment – I guess I just used this for 3 weeks max, I got so lazy putting it every day
* Aldara – I hate this. Wasted of money. The most painful cream I have put on my skin. My genitals were BURNING. Spread of warts was slow when I was on Aldara but I was so miserable. I can’t walk properly. Also these did not remove the warts anyway, not even the smallest ones
* TCA – Worked for bigger warts. I don’t think this works for flat warts, I’m not entirely sure, but I just wasted my money on this
* Cauterization – Works but only if it’s done well and only if there are no warts left
* Vitamins – I drank berocca once a week just to have some multivitamins
* Lysine tablets – Tried this because it was mentioned to help with HSV. Took for like 3 weeks, no effects on me
* HPV vaccine – GET THIS. Especially for women, please get this and save yourself from cervical cancer. Some STIs are covered of this vaccine as well.
* Mushroom supplements – I did not try this. I almost bought these expensive stuff but I’ve read there’s no credible study where it worked

**What** **Worked**

I can’t say what really worked for me. I can’t pinpoint which of the things I did worked it’s magic but here are my guesses:

* **Cauterization with the NGO** – the doctor burned off every single wart. I came home with little wounds and pain but I have not had a single wart since then
* **HPV vaccine** – throughout this journey, I was also undergoing my 3 doses of vaccine. I think this helped too as there’s a study that mentions that the vaccine helps even on already present warts.

But what I believe ultimately helped me clear my warts?

**My mental state.**

The mental stress I’ve had the entire time was nothing I have experience before. At the time, I was also meeting a guy and my self esteem really went so low when I found out I had warts.

Since the day I’ve noticed my wart, I have made a throwaway account on reddit, asking what I should do. Searching for cures, asking people what they did, looking for treatments I could do. Everyday and every night, I would sleep and wake up to me searching for things that could help my warts.

My screen time was really through the roof, and I haven’t been sleeping well too. I was so sad all the time, I felt so hopeless. Crying all day, all night. Can’t even act right when going out and going on dates.

Until I’ve read somewhere here that it drags them down reading from this subreddit every day. So, I thought, maybe they’re right.

This subreddit was truly helpful to me when it comes to educating me about STIs, the warts, and treatments. But when the time came that I already knew that information I kept rereading every day, it became depressing.

One day, I have decided that I will just go to this subreddit if I ever need to seek information about anything. I did that. Deleted my account, never went back again. Researched doctors available to me and went to work.

When the thought that I have warts and that I’m now unlovable came to my mind, I immediately shut it off. I always say, “I don’t have warts, I don’t have a virus, I living a normal life”. I say this to myself every day, until I believe it. Fake it til you make it. I was speaking and treating my daily life as if I did not have it… while I have it.

 

Also, one of the biggest things for me is I’m a **believer**. I’m not a hardcore religious Cristian, but I believe. So going to church, praying, and just venting and crying in a prayer really helped a lot. I was asking to be healed and I’m glad it was given to me! I’m thankful to the lord for helping me throughout this journey.

 

**The Experience and Lessons I’ve Learned**

* To always save money too! My savings went negative after this, but I was glad I had money saved for those treatments.
* Get a second opinion
* If you think the doctor is not doing anything right, you can say no (my ob recommending shaving my genitals and the warts, lol nope)
* You don’t have to tell your friends, look for a solid support system and stick with it. There’s still the stigma surrounding this thing, I know people would not agree with my approach. But I feel better now that I’ve dealt with this thing almost alone. I was able to go to doctor visits without anyone asking why. I did not have difficult conversations that would repeat over and over again.
* Believe in yourself, nobody else got you really. Be strong for yourself, you could get through it
* Be healthy. I did not have any lifestyle change and I also work the night shift. No drastic change but I make sure to opt for the healthier meals and walks and socialize for a better mental health
* Don’t doomscroll on this subreddit. Please don’t. If you already know enough about your situation, you may stop and revisit after a while. Stop clouding your mind
* It wouldn’t hurt to try NGOs that helps people with STIs. I went with a clinic that welcomes mostly LGBT folks but I was still welcomed as a straight woman
* Don’t waste money on stuff that did not have clinical evidence
* Get a PAP smear ladies. Thankfully, they did not find anything inside of me but I was reminded to still be checked after 2 years
* Don't shave down under! With or without warts, not ever! Trim instead! (Don't ever shave if you have warts, it will spread like wildfire)
* Please choose your sexual partners wisely. Not everyone will agree with me on this, but from what I went through, there’s not a chance that I will be letting someone I do not know in my body. I’d rather miss out on an hour of sex that have regrets and irreversible damage to my body

 

If you're facing a similar situation, remember that you’re not alone and THIS IS NOT THE END! Life is so beautiful and this is just a phase, we will all get through it!

I’m posting this because I wish I had read something like this when I started my journey. I hope I could help as much as this subreddit has helped me. I’m thankful to you guys for always being kind and giving.

 

You may ask me questions, I’ll try my very best to answer.

"My Best Bro let me down What I can’t understand.
If you know you have an std or think you have an std. why not, make your partner put on a condom. I get it, if you went to the doctor and was misdiagnosed and happen to spread warts or herpes, shit happens. But bro. If you’ve been labeled as having any std, especially herpes or GW  or HIV and you don’t want to disclose... put on a condom.

I myself have no STD on paper? HIV, Herpes 1&2, Hepatitis, etc. I do have HPV; However, you wouldn’t know unless i told you. My very good female friend and her bf which is my friend as well. Just blamed my friend her bf of. Giving her a wart. He was hypothetically clean, we all got tested for the 10 STD panel from STD check almost a year ago

Between us three. Everybody was good. Still kind of surprised nobody had antibodies to herpes. But all
Clean.  9 months later  my female friend develops a wart and fellas she was a virgin. And the guy a good friend. I had no inclination of his diagnosis. 

And it’s funny, after I was diagnosed last year. After having a wart for four years and being misdiagnosed. I told all my friends, if me mr. West Point former army captain can get a genital wart, it can def happen to
you guys. Be careful.

I feel like shit my. Army brother, frat brother and good friend did this. He’s mid 30s like me. He say he didn’t know. But Idk. And my female friend keeps asking me, we all got tested together, nobody was positive for the 10 panel test.  How could this happen. I let her know there is no test for men... Hopefully this doesn’t mess up the marriage..

All in all, guys disclose. If your not going to disclose, wear a condom, make sure your not breaking out. If you have HIV Try to be undetectable..  I hear is virtually impossible to pass that way, but still
Wear protection. And I know, you can still catch 
HPV from areas not covered. But come on most of us contacted HPV from not wearing condoms. I myself
24 women later in my 30s have gw.... and personally I don’t think 24 is a lot of women. But I was batting 30% on the condom usage. “ Army Life “ smh. 

Really saddened today by my buddy"	0
"Need help with my “research” Hi,

I am completely (but ignorantly) pro-vaccine. I have no medical knowledge and trust my children’s doctors, so I have never questioned vaccines before. 

I learned earlier this summer that a new friend of mine (I don’t have many friends) doesn’t vaccinate. She seems so down to earth, and is the first good friend I have made in a decade. She has sent me a few things and echos what I constantly hear “do the research and pick what’s best for your family”. I also live in a pretty conservative area and have seen recently that the majority of people in mom groups on various social platforms are strongly antivax. Like 9/10 moms. They have lots of links, and very scary info. Not sure if it is because I have looked at these links or what not but when I google vaccine research, particularly Covid vaccine research, most articles I read lean antivax unless government funded. 

I know vaccines have saved so many people. I know I strongly believe they are safe and effective but I have  hardly any evidence to back up my opinion. 

I’m not asking for you to do my research for me, just for help. So for those of you that have done your research where did you start? How did you know who to trust? 

I don’t want to be the type of person that is close minded to their opinion when presented with new information but how on earth can I know what is real!?? Please help. "	0
"[27m] 8 month journey over. Am free! *""If you have genital warts, you're about to not have genital warts.""*

For the large majority of us, warts are temporary and transient. 
See my previous post, but I went through the ringer including surgery for my warts. 

**My journey**

I thought I'd post an update for anyone who was interested. I'm male, 27yo, had 4 large warts in the sensitive area underneath my foreskin, tried aldara, cryo, surgery and finally podophyllotoxin along with Zinc + immune supplements. This ruined me temporary - I'm a young professional who was really ready to start dating finally. It felt isolating, and I felt dirty. To combat this, I told 2 of my closest friends about my situation who supported me, and did my best to keep a good mindstate. I ran, I ate healthy, I cut back on smoking. 

**The recovery**

Amazingly, a month after applying podophyllotoxin my visible warts just melted away, and I've had nil recurrence since (almost 5 months now). Podophyllotoxin all the way! (warning: do not confuse with *podophyllin*) 

Unfortunately the healing time was not without complication, as I would soon be diagnosed with balanitis afterwards (penis inflammation). This cleared up however with a combination of steroids and fungal cream (all bought over the counter at the chemist). Currently however, my bits and pieces are back to normal!! 

For the guys, suck it up and go to the Doctor if you can. It's really not that bad. If cryo didn't work for you the first time around, I recommend Podophyllotoxin over Aldara. It's a little solution you apply with a cottonbud twice a day for 3 days. And yup - it melts the warts away.

**The lessons**

Here is what I learnt through my trip - mental health is important. You are not dirty, most people have it, they just don't know. It isn't your fault either. You didn't *choose* to have HPV, nobody does, so stop beating yourself up for it. Also remind yourself that this subreddit attracts the crazier cases that aren't sorted, and is probably not representative of most the population who will recover fully. Reading too many horror cases can be pretty anxiety inducing, so a grain of salt goes a long way. 

The moderator of this subreddit, u/xdhpv, once private messaged me and said the biggest indicator that HPV is temporary is the fact that so many accounts on this subreddit become active and then inactive after a few months. Most people who recover, won't post that they've recovered. Stay strong everyone, keep in mind that sadness comes in waves, so feel free to re-visit this post and remind yourself that you'll be fine.

With all this said - thanks for reading. It's finally my turn to become inactive here, and trust me, eventually it will be *yours*."	1
Covid vaccine question A few weeks ago i got my first shot of pfizer and before getting jabbed the doctor asked if i plan on having kids, i’m just curious as to why he’s ask that, does it mayhaps have a link to infertility?	1
"Always consult your Doctor. Vaccination is a medical procedure and you should always consult your doctor.  Consider getting a second or even third opinion if you are not happy or confident with your doctor's advice or have any doubts.

Always read and make sure you understand all the documentation such as warning labels that comes with every vaccine that you are considering using and if you don't like anything you read in that documentation do not go ahead with the medical procedure until you are satisfied it meets your standards for safety and effectiveness.

Check the newspapers for any stories about litigation or adverse events that have happend with other people with the vaccine you are considering.

A vaccine is a medical procedure that may have life long effects for you or your loved one. Do not take the decisions to get  a vaccine lightly.

If you are in a poor country consider getting your vaccination in a rich country that has better vaccine supply lines like refrigeration and will also be able to support you better with emergency care post vaccination if you need it.

Consider if you are insured against the harm from vaccine injury.

Vaccine manufactures, public health authorities and even your own doctor are not going to be bearing the responsibility for your vaccine choices so make sure you are absolutely sure of your decisions before you go ahead with the procedure."	1
"Tolerance for AntiVaxers should be the gold standard of any vaccine. The vaccine is supposed to work.   It is your shield against the disease.   So, you have absolutely nothing to fear from an anti-vaxer.    

You are not going to get the disease from them, are you?   So no need to fret.   If they choose to develop the anti-bodies via the biology that has taken nature many millennia  to perfect, they should be freely allowed to do so.    No harm can come to you, because you have taken the vaccine.

Clearly, intolerance for anti-vaxers is an admission that the vaccine is not effective."	1
"Rise in chronic diseases, autism, diabetes, cancer, auto immune diseases CDC itself, the vaccine proponents company, admit that rates of diabetes, and obesity have risen high amounts over the last 40 years. 

The rates of auto immune diseases have on average risen from 15 per year in 1970 to about 400 per year in 2010.

The rates of autism has risen too, by 50 fold! 50 times. Over the past 50 years. Too much to be explained by simple advances in technology, and diagnosis prevelancy. 

The rates of chronic diseases in children under 18 has risen from 10% in the 1960s, to 55% in the last 2 years. 

The rates of diabetes has Risen from 2% in 1960 to 7% in 2018.

The rate of cancer has Risen from 300000 per year in 1969, to 650000 per year in 2018.

The rates of asthma allergic rhinitis and disabling asthma and atopic eczema, have all risen from around 0.1% in 1969 all the way to 1% to 10% in 2000. 

The rates of food allergies have risen from 6 in 1 million in 1988 to 30 in 1 million in 2000.

Maybe we need to stop injecting things, into our kids, that mess with and confuse their immune systems in ways that it naturally never experiences or rarely does. And maybe we need to stop giving treatment for diseases, and instead try to prevent them with education, better health and diet, exercise, better hygiene and being less reliant on medication and drugs and technology.

Maybe other factors are at play, I admit, but maybe one place to look, is the very thing that is related wholly to the immune system, the bloodstream, the gut, and then in turn the brain.
So, who's lookin? I don't see GSK, MERCK, CDC, FDA, or any of the pharmaceutical companies doing it? Who will?

Right now, we need is common sense.
Not technology.

Technology is great, but we need to be careful not to rely on it, and lose our natural abilities and skills."	-1

"Help? So me and my partner were having a talk on the way home from work and he talked about how he went to the doctors every year and got his yearly shots. He asked me when i got mine and I was like ""were supposed to be getting yearly shots?"". he was flabbergasted thought i was joking and asked when the last time i went to a doctor was and i told him it had been like 5 years (2019) and my last vaccine was the covid vaccine. Were both 17 and he urged me to talk to my parents about going to the doctors and getting my shots since he said they were no joke. I talked to my mother and all she said was that I didnt need the vaccines since they had mercury and that ""good food will keep me healthy"". Shes a woman whos obsessed with the facebook health gurus who try and sell you bunches of vitamins that ""you need"". Anyways, my question is if im screwed. My mother defiently would not take me to the doctor to get my shots and i feel like the only thing i can do is wait for my 18th birthday which is only a couple of months away.  So is that my best bet currently or is there something else i could do?"	0
"HPV disclosure - open discussion As you know HPV can be cleared by the immune system or become not detectable. CDC says ""More than 90% of new HPV infections, including those caused by high-risk HPV types, clear or become undetectable within 2 years, and clearance usually occurs in the first 6 months after infection."".

It means that:

* some people clear HPV infection
* some people have persistent HPV infection
* some people have latent / dormant HPV infection

If you have persistent infection (high risk HPV on HPV PCR tests OR genital warts recurring for long time) then it's simple: YOU SHOULD DISCLOSE. Active infection = high viral load = it means that you are contagious. Of course lots of people don't know about their HPV infection but it doesn't mean that you should spread HPV. No one wants this shit.

In case of genital warts remember about recurrences. As CDC says:

> Recurrence of anogenital warts within 3 months is common (approximately 30%), whether clearance occurs spontaneously or following treatment

https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt05-hpv.html

so again: disclose. But later (after a few months) it's getting more complicated:

Immune system can remove the virus OR the virus can stay in latency. How many people will have latent / dormant infection? It's really hard to say. There are no 100% bulletproof numbers. But we can suppose that...

> A key uncertainty in the natural history of HPV infection within an individual is whether an HPV infection that becomes undetectable on repeat testing has truly cleared, or whether the virus persists at low, undetectable levels or has entered a latent state. While distinctions between the latter two scenarios are controversial, studies suggest that re-detection of the same HPV type is relatively common, occurring in at least 10–20% of women observed to have “cleared” the virus

https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/9/10/267/htm

And now - this re-detection of the same HPV strain can be caused by reinfection with the same strain OR reactivation of the latent infection. Latent infections can be reactivated by i.e. pregnancy / ageing / weaker immune system / mechanical wounds (animal studies) / UV light (animal studies). 

**What doctors say about disclosing HPV?**

First opinion:

> Given the ubiquitous nature of HPV infection, unless her partner is a virgin, the odds are pretty darned high that he already has had HPV. He may actually have the infection right now and be the one who gave it to her. On the other hand, he may have had it in the past and already be immune to the strain of HPV she has. Or be infected with another strain she does not have, so that she may actually be the one taking the risk by sleeping with him.

> There is no role for partner notification and  treatment in preventing the spread of HPV. The only thing that partner notification accomplishes is to turn women with abnormal paps into pariahs, while the rest of the HPV infected men and women out there continue to copulate in blissful ignorance.

> I do think it’s worth discussing with your current partner if you discover that you have genital warts.More often that you’d think, the male partner may have  small, previously undetected genital warts that are amenable to treatment. He can visit his doc for a careful exam and get treated if warts are present. That in turn may help you clear the infection faster yourself, since your immune system won’t be under constant barrage with high viral loads from your partner.

> The good news for HPV-infected women is that almost all HPV infections will clear. Once HPV is gone, your increased risk for cervical cancer goes with it. As does your risk for transmitting the virus to others. Which takes care of the issue of future partners.

http://www.tbtam.com/2012/01/must-tell-your-partners-that-have-hpv-doc-says-no.html

Second opinion:

> ""If you know you are HPV positive [with a low-risk strain not known to commonly cause cancer], I don’t feel you have to disclose that to your partner,"" Jacques Moritz, ob/gyn at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian, tells SELF, noting that even though safe-sex barriers like condoms and dental dams don't fully prevent HPV transmission, you should still use them. Moritz isn't adamant about people needing to disclose those forms of HPV because they're so common and usually not a risk to your health. ""Any man or woman should assume their partner has HPV because it’s that ubiquitous,"" he explains. So ubiquitous, in fact, that doctors don't routinely test for HPV during Pap smears when a woman is under 30, he adds. But there are still reasons it can be a good idea to tell your partner.

Third opinion:

> Many of the 150 viruses that fall under the HPV umbrella won't harm you at all, and you'll never know you had one because they often clear from your system all on their own, board-certified ob/gyn Antonio Pizarro, M.D., tells SELF. “It’s not a badge of shame,” Pizarro says, so telling someone usually doesn’t need to be a huge production. “I would just bring it up as saying you’ve tested positive for HPV, it’s super common, and a lot of people have it,"" he says.

https://www.self.com/story/telling-partners-about-hpv

Fourth opinion:

> “HPV is extraordinarily common and is the most common sexually transmitted disease. Almost every sexually active person gets exposed to at least one, if not several, of the 15 carcinogenic viruses,” said Mark Schiffman, MD, head of the HPV unit at the Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics at the National Cancer Institute (NCI).

> “If you’ve got HIV, you’ve got HIV, but if you’ve got HPV, you’re about to not have HPV,” Schiffman said. “Nine out of 10 times you don’t have it in two years. Maybe your body suppresses it like chickenpox, maybe it is completely gone, but the result is that you are OK.”

> “If you look at the curve, what it shows is that if you wait six months, you’ve gotten rid of half your worry,” Schiffman said.

https://www.healio.com/infectious-disease/stds/news/print/infectious-disease-news/%7Baf692634-fd8f-4598-926d-1847b0ea5e5f%7D/many-hpv-infections-may-clear-quickly-without-treatment

Dr Handsfield, fifth opinion (from 2009):

> What can be said with certainty is that the most sensitive tests available--tests that detect HPV DNA in genital tissues--become negative within 6-12 months in over 90% of infected persons. We also know that once the test becomes negative, the person is immune to catching the same HPV type again, which is further evidenced that the infection was truly eradicated by the immune system. However, it remains possible that HPV DNA (or maybe even intact virus particles) persists in small amounts, too small for detection by the available tests. Whether this happens at all, or in what proportion of infected persons, cannot be known with certainty with available technology. But if infection persists, it almost certainly is in amounts to small to be transmitted to another person and probably will never re-grow to cause warts or precancerous growth. But in most persons the most infections are controlled by the immune system and most experts believe they are truly cured. For ""quick and dirty"" responses by clinicians like me, the evidence is good enough to say ""cure"" and to reassure our patients accordingly. 

> My practical take-home message is that after several months with no wart recurrence, normal pap, the person can consider him/herself cured; this is practically true if not always biologically true. Such persons probably transmit HPV to future partners rarely, if ever. Accordingly, I do not consider it ethically mandatory, or even recommended, that every person who ever has had HPV must henceforth and forever tell future partners they once were infected. My personal judgment is that you should inform partners in the next 3-4 months after your warts have disappeared, but if after then you have had no recurrences, you can safely assume your immune system has cleared the HPV infection and no longer need inform partners. 

>  For a new partner, you probably can start having sex as soon as the warts clear up. That soon, you SHOULD tell your partner, because there is still some chance of transmission. If s/he is aware of the low risk of an adverse outcome and feels OK with proceeding, don't let HPV stand in your way. If it has been longer than 6 months, I don't think you need say anything. Some people would endorse 3 months, 4 months, or a year; the science doesn't allow any more precision than this. I say 6 months. 

https://ehealthforum.com/health/info-on-hpv-t173358.html

Dr Handsfield in 2019: answer to the question #4882

> Over time, almost all HPV infections are suppressed or entirely eradicated by the immune system.

> Our usual advice about genital warts is that people should either abstain with new partners, or advise potential partners of their infection, for 3-6 months after treatment, then not necessary if no recurrence of the wart. These are not science-based guidelines, just a common sense approach of many STD experts. 

> But none of this applies to current, ongoing partner(s). You can safely assume regular partners have already been repeatedly exposed, and no need or benefit to stopping contact now. That horse is long out of the barn, no use in closing the door now.

https://www.askexpertsnow.com/ask-the-experts/

Sixth opinion, from /r/Virology /u/CJay07

> I studied HPV for my PhD work, and the statement that ""HPV is with you for life"" isn't accurate. Most sexually active individuals are infected with HPV at one point during their lifetime. Epidemiological estimates range from 60-80% by the time you reach your forties. However, most infections are cleared by the immune system within a few months. A small subset of those individuals that do not clear the virus maintain a persistent infection (~1-2 years), but even those infections get cleared. An even smaller set of people go on to cancer. By that time however, the virus is generally long gone. One common situation in HPV-associated cancer is where the viral genome accidentally becomes a part of the host chromosome and the oncogenic (tumor promoting) elements of the virus become constitutively expressed. Those elements lead to rapid cell growth, among other things. Despite a little bit of the viral genome present at this stage, no viral particles can (or will be) produced.

> HPV infects basal epithelial stem cells, which are self renewing and give rise to the rest of the skin architecture. Here, the virus is maintained as an episome (viral DNA tethered to the host chromosome). There are no in tact virus particles here. Just viral DNA. It takes about three weeks for daughter cells (cells produced from the epithelial stem cells) to reach the surface, and it is not until during the final stages of cellular differentiation (cells becoming keratinized, stratifying, forming the uppermost layers of the skin) that you actually get the production of infectious virus particles. The virus coat (capsid), which envelops and protects the viral DNA, is produced very late during skin differentiation. This is a very fancy mechanism for immune evasion if you think about it. The superficial layers of the skin are not routinely surveyed by the immune system (because these cells are going to die), so by the time HPV expresses its most immunogenic products (the capsid proteins), immune cells are rarely to be found. This is one thought for how HPV can persist for so long (months to years), although the virus has many other ""tricks"" up its sleeve to hide from the immune system. With all that being said, when I say ""virus is cleared"", I mean the viral DNA is gone from its reservoir cell (the epithelial stem cell). Once that is gone, you don't have new viral particles being produced, and those particles that are hanging out on/in the skin will be lost during the natural turnover of the skin. This process wouldn't take long. It's more on the order of weeks, rather than years.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Virology/comments/5pu24a/question_about_hpv_virus/

Q: Are there any studies about HPV disclosure?

A: Of course yes.

> This study provides the first data on the correlates and outcomes of male-to-female disclosure of HR-HPV infection. Disclosure did not lead to a perceived worsening relationship, and as disclosers were more likely to discuss the Pap test/HPV vaccine with their partners than non-disclosers, disclosure might be associated with public health benefits that derive from discussions about preventing HPV infections and cervical cancer.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3398400/

When I had a hard time with HPV I got lots of positive feedback from /r/UpperLeftyOne [RIP] so that's what she once wrote:

> HPV isn't a forever infection like herpes. Eventually, you can say with certainty, that you are clear of the infection. The problem lies is knowing when this is true. (...) So the longer you are free from physical signs of warts, the safer it is to say that you've cleared the infection. The problem is that you can't see very well. I would absolutely disclose until you've had another pelvic exam and/or Pap smear to verify that there are no more warts. It is not uncommon to have to treat warts more than once before the virus is cleared.

And how about you? What is your opinion? Do you know any other useful quotes / evidence? 

In my opinion it's important to:

* do everything to clear the infection
* keep the healthy lifestyle (no smoking / no drugs / no heavy drinking)
* vaccinate yourself with Gardasil or Gardasil 9
* use condoms (you can still get Herpes and other stuff, right?)
* in case of serious relationships: **it's better to disclose and vaccinate sexual partners**

And what CDC says about disclosure?

> the value of disclosing a past diagnosis of genital HPV infection to future partners is unclear, although candid discussions about past STDs should be supported whenever possible.

"Some positive news Hi all,
I was diagnosed with HPV 16 and other strains in 2019. I had colposcopies every year and they always came back CIN1 so I was told to just wait. Come 2023 and I see another doctor and go through the biopsies again. It’s still CIN1 but since my body hasn’t cleared that or the HPV she suggested we do the conization and I finally get the HPV vaccine. I had surgery June 21st and healed really well. Clear margins. She told me that this might help but there’s no guarantee it’ll cure the HPV. Last week I had my follow up pap and final shot. I thought that it was a long shot but it came back as completely clear, no HPV at all anymore. I didn’t think it would ever happen but I’m so happy. I’m in a long term monogamous relationship with someone I plan to marry so it’s my hope I never have to deal with this again! I wish positive outcomes for everyone here!"	1
"TO: International Society of Vaccines-Inovio: ""INO-3107 induced durable cellular responses and was able to generate T-cells against HPV-6 and HPV-11. Reduction of surgeries compared to baseline demonstrated in 26 patients (81.3%) Adverse events, 3107 RRP administration: 12/32 grade1, 1/32 grade 2. ***Clinical Assessment of Adjuvant Immunotherapy, INO-3107, in Adult Patients with Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP)***

Objective(s): To evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of INO-3107, a DNA vaccine designed to elicit targeted T-cell responses against HPV-6 and HPV-11, in adult patients with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP; NCT04398433) 

Methods: **Eligible patients required ?2 surgical interventions for RRP in the year preceding dosing (median 4 surgeries/preceding year)**. INO-3107 was administered by intramuscular (IM) injection via a device on Weeks 0, 3, 6, and 9. 

Patients underwent surgical debulking within 14 days of the first dose, and office laryngoscopy with staging at screening and Weeks 6, 11, 26, and 52. 

The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability assessed by treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). 

Secondary endpoints included the frequency of surgical interventions post INO-3107 and cellular immune responses. 

Results: Of the 32 adult RRP patients enrolled in the study 13 (41%) reported a treatment-related AE. **The most frequent treatment-related AE’s reported were Injection site pain (31%) and fatigue (9%).** One TEAE (pain) was Grade 2 severity. All other TEAE reports were Grade 1. No treatment-related adverse events greater than grade 2 severity were reported. 

Modified Derkay-Pransky severity scores improved from baseline to Week 52.

INO-3107 induced durable cellular responses and was able to generate T-cells against HPV-6 and HPV-11. Reduction of surgeries compared to baseline was demonstrated in 26 patients (81.3%). Conclusion: INO-3107 is tolerable and immunogenic. The evidence demonstrates a clinical benefit as the majority of adult RRP patients who received therapy required fewer surgical procedures compared to baseline."	1

"Vaccines did not fucking cause my mental disabilities/illness My ADHD and aspergers did not come from getting immunized, that’s literally just how my brain was created. Doctors preventing me from getting polio did not change the way my brain is wired; it’s been like that my whole life and will continue to fuck me over until the day I die. I have had two neuropsych evaluations done in my life- once was when I was younger, which was when I was initially diagnosed, and once was more recent (because of some ACT bullshit rules saying I had to have a more recent test  to get extra time). I did not have all my vaccinations or even most of them done when I took the first test, and I had all of them done by the time I took the second test. The diagnoses from both tests were consistent. So um. Yeah. I’m thinking it wasn’t vaccines. If vaccines did cause my mental disabilities, you’d think that there would’ve been some change from before and after I had all my vaccinations.

My depression also did not come from vaccines; it is very much genetic- history of depression in previous generations on both sides of the family, both parents are on antidepressants, and three other people on my mom’s side of the family have struggled with depression and are on antidepressants. The obvious conclusion to draw there would be that it’s genetic."	1

Also, side note: I got Pfizer covid vaccines and boosted and literally had no reactions whatsoever. Barely even a sore arm for the booster.

"I'd like to be able to have civil discourse, and comment more frequently than every 10 minutes. I have been for a month now, and I am tired of having to not respond to people because of the huge wait being outweighed by the number of replies I get.

This is a discussion page, I'm here to debate, to discuss why I think vaccines are potentially dangerous, why they are potentially not very useful, why measles is not an awful epidemic zombie virus, and why  the first world should no longer rely on vaccines and technology, over education, common sense and sensibility. 

And why people, instead of looking for ways to slowly, efficiently, and without causing more problems, to remove diseases ASAP, to remove them efficiently, and think about the future not just the wants of right now, and to think about whether or not it's really so urgent that we should rush to make vaccines without enough research, without enough testing or without enough knowledge.

Scientists in the field of immunology, still, have little understanding of how it works, and how to utilize it for progression to better health.

And yet we already are arrogant enough to think that we can do everything now, fix it all, and no problems will come with it!

It's all about now now now, me me me, instead of, wait wait, them them them, not just me me me.

The recent trend of the last 50 years has been, technology is the way, it's the answer to everything. Just look at anti depressants, and the opiote crisis, and how anti depressants and long term pain killers actually make things worse for people.

The moon landing, I know was contrived by the cold war, but was it mostly about accomplishing the future, instead of fixing the future.

So, as I discuss here, how to help the future accomplish their now, not accomplish the future, in our now. I would like to have the free speech and freedom to discourse over these important ideas, and having a 10 minute cool down isn't fair.

Let's help the futures now, not do the futures now."	-1

"Omicron: feelings vs fact - wait a second NOTE: I think all adults should be vaccinated - the benefits are established.  And Im not commenting on kids beyond saying apparently healthy kids have extremely low risk. .(I want to be clear on that.)

&#x200B;

There is a main fact that he touched on but avoided addressing directly.

Apparently healthy, and vaccinated people under 30(and probably 40) have shockingly low risk from COVID.  In fact apparently healthy  under 30 with no vaccine - have very low risk.  Once you add in the vaccine - the risk is vanishingly small.

And apparently healthy people under 60 who are vaccinated also have quit low risk of anything serious.

&#x200B;

No body wants to come out and say it but apparently healthy young people and middle aged people with vaccine have no logical reason to be worried.  Their only concern should be if they have contact with people at high risk.

&#x200B;

The real issue is should we accept  a 2 tiered society where  healthy people live open and good lives and at risk people have to be super careful.  It seems were basing policy on trying to not make at risk people feel bad.  Maybe were in a situation where we should be telling at risk people they should wear N95s everywhere and avoid eating out etc,  and tell everyone else - get vaccinated and move on.

Hi I'm Antivax, and I would like some good arguments for vaccines being dangerous. Other than autism, what do they cause?	0
This guy works with kids.. For context, this guy and I were arguing on Instagram about vaccines, he later slid into my DMs. Lots of homophobic words for someone who wants to grape another man.

"Understanding the antivaxxers I want to start this off by saying that I am pro-vaccine. I believe that they work and that you should get them. I also don't think that they cause autism. I have autism myself, but I'm of the belief that it has nothing to do with vaccines.


I also want to say that if you don't want to get vaccinated, you don't have to. I myself am skeptical of the COVID vaccine because I don't think it was that effective as a preventer of the virus. I do stand to be corrected, though, and wish for it to happen.


I also understand that those in the pro life camp have issues with some of the vaccines. From what I understand, some of the vaccines were researched on stem cells from fetuses. Is this true? Is there some truth to it?


My main goal, besides my inquiries being answered, is to gain understanding into the reasons an antivaxxer has for their beliefs. Even if I disagree with you, I still want to understand why you believe the way you do so that I may gain understanding into other viewpoints. Everyone believes that they are rational; I want to hear your rationale. "	0
"1a1 squamous cell carcinoma Hi Ladies! I would really appreciate if you would like to share your experience being staged 1a1.

I was staged 1a1 June22’ due to a recurrent/persistent HPV16. I was 38. The leep got away the carcinoma focus (1mm) but the margins came compromised (endocervical part).

Got the Gardasil vaccine and muy husband as well. 3 shots. Across 22’

In Sep 22’ got my first control, pap, colpo and pcr. All came fine.

My anxiety and mental help didnt allow me to mover forward. I got second Leep just to be sure there were no more carcinoma focus left behind. The leep came with no residual illness.

Still, highly traumatized about the whole experience, always anxious thinking that perhaps The virus can come back or carcinoma cells could develop again.


I would really appreciate to hear your stories and wether or not you had hysterectomy instead of leep.

I do not have kids yet and I would like to have the opportunity.  However, the drs never proposed me hysterectomy regardless my child desire. However, I have read so many posts on here where almost all of you had hysterectomy. Please I would need to know if someone with my same stage was left just with a leep treatment."	0

"Read if you’re worried ?? Hey everyone,
I just wanted to come on here and say, breathe.

Take a moment to relax, take a deep breath, and free yourself from overthinking/worrying. 

It’s scary reading all of these different posts, but just remember… 
You are not your HPV symptoms/results and it does NOT define you or your life unless you allow it ??????
Go watch a movie with friends.
Have fun with your kids/spouse/parents.
Exercise and build your best body. 
Walk in a park and listen to your favorite music.
Go get a damn pet.
Fucking laugh, laugh, LAUGH.??
There’s too much that this beautiful world has to offer to be worried about something MOST people get in life… unless they’re a nun ?? 

Most importantly… forgive yourself. Seriously. 
I can’t emphasize how much I hated myself when I noticed a cluster of GW on my anus.
I lost so much sleep from worrying about this. 
You deserve to be free of self-blame and self-hate. 

Let me remind you that most cases of HPV, including the high risk strains, do go away. 

And just because you don’t get rid of it in 2 years doesn’t automatically mean it’s persistent. 
Some strains just take longer to get rid of. 

I pray and hope that everyone reading this doesn’t lose sleep over this, is able to have a worry-free day, able to laugh at themselves, and able to lead happy lives ??????

"Should I warn my ex’s new gf he gave me a high risk HPV strain? My ex (M33) is a narcissist, and I (34F) found out I had gotten a high-risk HPV strain from him in January. Of course he blamed me but all my last paps were normal and I had only been with him. He cheated on me in the end and 4 weeks after the breakup, he had a new gf already (she’s 50 and a mother of 2)

Anyways it’s caused a lot of stress and worry obviously - I am 34 with kids and terrified it’ll develop into cancerous cells. I can do nothing but wait it out and monitor it. He also gave me an STI which I discovered at the same time & treated, but he lied saying “I was tested in September” and again blamed me. 

Should I tell her?? I only have her Facebook account. If it were any other STD I would know to leave it be but high-risk HPV feels different & is scarier. I don’t want him back. I need to heal. I’m worried I will look crazy and she will tell him & he will get some sort of revenge on me. I’d rather let it lie but feel sort of guilty doing that? Like I am not following girl-code. She’s a mom too & in hindsight, had someone warned me, I’d be grateful. 

What would you do?? Are there any ways to inform her without me being involved directly? He sleeps around so it would be plausible but he’d most definitely suspect me because I left him for lying about getting tested.

"Why doesn't everyone vaccinate against everything? As the question asks, why doesn't everyone vaccinate against everything? Just to make sure that were safe from everything we have a vaccine against, might as well get the vaccine for it, no?

I was looking through my vaccination record, and saw that most available vaccines haven't been done (although the important ones have been), so it made me wonder. Why not get extra protection, even if it isn't specifically necessary or even if you're not particularly at risk? I get that depending on where you live you're more or less at risk of contracting different diseases, but why not vaccinate against everything as a prevention measure, to be as protected as possible?

 For example, imagine I travel to the Baltics (and just plan on staying there for a weekend), and then right as I leave the airport, I fall on some tall grass and unfortunately I contract TBE (tick-borne encephalitis) which can be lethal and can't be cured, only prevented. Since I just planned on going there for 2 days there wasn't really a ""need"" to get this vaccine or maybe I didn't even know it existed, but now I find myself with a disease that has a chance of killing me or at least causing severe unrecoverable long term neurological complications.

Ideally the person traveling would know before hand that they need to get a certain vaccine, but what if they don't? There isn't anything being checked, I could go to Latvia or Lithuania for 6 months and still not get a vaccine.

So my question is, why isn't there a certain period in our lives where we just do every vaccine possible in order to protect ourselves as most as possible? Is the reason that it costs money for something that has a low chance of happening? Or that you're putting yourself ""at risk"" from doing vaccines you don't necessarily need?"	0
"My Molluscum Contagiosum Story I want to start this post off by saying this is my first post and most likely my last. My experience with Molluscum was difficult mentally and I feel that if I had a place to come and ask questions and feel comfortable that I would not have been so tough on myself throughout the process

First and foremost, if you’re reading this because you think you “might” have molluscum or there is a chance, go to the doctor. My doctor was understanding and the only person that knew of my situation for a long time and he helped me to realize that this is not a death sentence and time will heal this.

Second, if you are here because you know you have it and are concerned about your illness I just want you to know that it’s okay. People make poor choices or get unlucky every day in the world and I am so sorry that you’re dealing with this but I promise you will get healthy and there are so many people that would do anything to help you no matter the circumstances

Lastly, if you’re on this post and have no STD or have never even had sex then PLEASE always wrap up or make the guy wrap up. It is common to think these things will never happen to you but you don’t really know where someone else has been or what has been in them/they have been in. I would hope that I don’t have to explain this to those who have or have had StDs




Now that I got that out of the way, here is my personal story.

In March of this year I met a girl that I had unprotected sex with and didn’t think much of it. Come April of this year I had some pain on my right testicle and was afraid that it was herpes or the early stages of HPV. I went to the doctor the morning after noticing this and quickly was told that I did not have herpes but HPV was still a possibility and I needed to keep an eye on two suspicious bumps that had appeared. 
Me, being young and dumb, thought this meant I was fine. I went about my business, had unprotected sex, masturbated, you get the point.

Come May, I am noticing a couple more bumps here and there but don’t really think much of it. One morning in June I woke up and it was bad... I mean BAD. My entire right side of my penis was covered in what appeared to be pimples that just would not pop (I found out after my diagnosis that it is horrible to try and pop them so DO NOT, IT WILL ONLY SPREAD MORE). This is when I realized that there was a major problem and I needed help. I was young enough that I was living with my parents at the time and began to discuss with them the possibility of going to see a dermatologist. I received the information for one and was so scared that I waited another two weeks to do anything.

At this point there were so many thoughts swirling in my head. What if it was HPV? What if it was cancer? What if I had HIV and this was some weird effect? In retrospect, this was all so dumb, the answer I needed was one doctors appointment away and I was going to need to go eventually regardless.

I’m not sure if you believe in god or not but I had a strange moment that happened and convinced me to go to the doctor. I found a lump on my left testicle and decided that it was time whether I liked it or not to figure out what the hell was going on. I said fuck the dermatologist and went to the doctor I have been going to since I was practically a baby, I knew him, felt comfortable with him, and knew that was where I wanted to go. In these situations I have found it is most important to make yourself as comfortable as possible. Penis/vagina issues are never fun to talk about but they are the baby makers... (side note: bump was my vas deferens I’m just an idiot)

I end up going to the doctor and he essentially tells me that I am very lucky this wasn’t HPV because that was what he originally suspected from the story I had told (essentially everything above).

He tells me there is good news and bad news. The good news is that this is not going to be an infection for life, however the bad news is that this takes forever to get rid of (my doc said 9 months to 3 years). He tells me there isn’t much that they can do for me and sends me on my way. He explains that usually kids are treated with cutting, freezing, or acid burning the bumps off. With this being my penis, I decided that I would give it one year and reassess if I still felt that not having these procedures done was most effective.

The girl from the beginning of the story left me soon after my diagnosis and that was one of the hardest things for me to deal with. I felt like there was something wrong with me even though there was a fair chance I contracted it from this girl. The most difficult part about this infection in my opinion is the mental headcase it turns you into. You think you’re a disgusting freak but nobody knows your issue so you’re still the same person in your friends eyes. I let this pick at my brain and destroy me mentally and then decided to tell 4 of my best friends when things became too much. I don’t know if I have the best friends ever but they all felt so bad for me and said that if I ever needed anything they would be one call/text/car ride away. This made it easier to vent in all honesty and sometimes that’s all you need.

This is probably the part that everyone is wondering if they have molluscum. What can you do to help the issue?

First off, I did a ton of research when I was sick and you’re going to see a lot of posts telling you to poke and cut these open and I’m telling you now that is totally unnecessary. All you’re going to do is spread the infection elsewhere or even give it to someone else unintended not to mention you will scar.

Second, I found that when your body begins to beat the infection the white cell within the molluscum begins to protrude out mildly. I bought an extra pair of tweezers and designated these as my dirty PP tweezers. If you turn your shower water heat up very high it seems to push the white cell out even further and this was when I would tweeze them. No cutting, poking, or whatever science experiment other posts are telling you do to do. Just time, hot water, and a pair of tweezers. Remove them and wash the tweezers after each individual molluscum. Also be careful with the white core because you can easily spread the infection at this time. The only real reason I did this was because I began to notice bumps on the iNside of my thigh and was over this bullshit virus and was not dealing with it spreading. These will bleed a decent amount and the white core should slide right off. If it gives resistance don’t poke it give it 24 hours and it will be ready. BE PATIENT.

Third, get two towels and dry your privates first with one and use the other for the other parts of the body.

Fourth, figure out your support system. Whether that is friends or family, I would suggest having numerous cause when th girl left me I felt a bit lost and alone with molluscum.

Fifth, go to the doctor sooner rather than later. Letting it fester is only going to make recovery longer and the infection more visible overall. Doctors have seen everything, they’re not going to judge you just help you and give you information on safe practices moving forward

Sixth, STOP MASTURBATING you horny mf. If you’re going to, try and figure out how to without coming into contact with your bumps. This was how I spread them the most along with the next point...

Seventh, if a significant othergives you an STI or StD it is not their fault and it is not right to become angry or upset with them. I had a really good conversation with the girl I was with about things she had been tested for and was able to reason out a lot of the big infections I was afraid of. Instead, I would have a conversation on expectations and if you will be a mutually exclusive relationship. I ended up getting two STis and believe that I was under the wrong impression and could’ve avoided a lot of these issues had I matured and had a conversation and stopped having sex while sick.

I want to leave this post with saying that my infection lasted a total of 6 or 7 months and I’m now fully health and looking for my next girl to treat me right and keep my PP healthy. I am sorry this is so long but I feel the post helping even one person would be a win in my book. 

PLEASE if you have any questions or concerns with your situation reach out on this and I will check back to help those that need it. I am not a doctor and would suggest that over me but understand that this is a tough situation and conversation to have."	0

Vaxart will be hosting a Key Opinion Leader Webinar on Monday, May 3 at 12:00pm EST. If there is any new information the company will be disclosing, they will need to release an SEC filing prior to the webinar. It could come at 8:30am EST, it could be 30 minutes before the webinar. Vaxart plans to present new data comparing T-Cell responses from their vaccine candidate compared to other vaccines (Moderna, Pfizer, JNJ) along with new mucosal antibody data results that suggest Vaxart's vaccine is potentially protective against new and emerging strains of the Rona.

After they present the data, a non-smooth brain named Dr. Mark Davis will talk about T-cells and why they are important. More about this in a minute. Dr. Davis was educated at John Hopkins, received his PhD at Cal Tech, and has been teaching and researching at Stanford since 1985. He is the Director of the Stanford Human Systems Immunology Center. He's solved some major mysteries on T-cells over the years and even created a system of labeling t-cells according to the molecules they recognize, kind of like the Dewey Decimal system for books, only with T-cells. This process is used all over the world when running experiments and trials. He's authored 407 scientific publications, most on immunology and t-cells. He has 9 patents on T-cells for processes and devices.

**Option Papa’s Opinions and Smooth Brain Understanding:**

Dr. Davis is a pioneer in the field and has remained on the cutting edge for 35+ years. He is among the top experts in the world on the subject of T-cells...let's get back to them. Anti-bodies are like army soldiers walking off the field of combat. Your body got infected, your body fought back and won, the anti-bodies are evidence of the viral infection, the battle and the immune system’s victory. Cytotoxic T-cells (also called killer T-cells) prevent infection from taking root on the surface of infection throughout the body, but for Vaxart specifically in the mucous linings of your mouth, nose, lungs, and eyes.

As the Rona lands on those places, with anti-bodies your body would notice an infection is occurring and begin to assemble anti-bodies to do battle with the infection, all the while the virus is invading more and more cells and spreading. Killer T-cells are like air superiority in a ground war. They see the rona has landed and instead of waiting for the army to assemble and march, the T cells are a Predator Drones, buzzing around 24/7, they notice the viral incursion, swoops in and drop a payload at the site of infection. There's no wounded soldiers (anti-bodies) as evidence the fight happened, because the T-cells came in and destroyed the virus when it landed on their territory - the mucosal areas. This prevents the virus from taking root and the body becoming infected. 

[https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/antibodies-t-cells-protect-against-sars-cov-2](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/antibodies-t-cells-protect-against-sars-cov-2)

[https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/antibodies-fight-off-the-new-coronavirus-but-what-do-t-cells-do](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/antibodies-fight-off-the-new-coronavirus-but-what-do-t-cells-do)

Dr. Davis will likely make the case that herd immunity will be very difficult to achieve without elevated T-cell responses in the whole population, because T-cells likely cross protect against all variants, unlike some of the other vaccines that are variant specific, attacking the spike protein, which mutates often and creates new variants.

Vaxart will reiterate the issues of cold chain storage and transportation, vial mixing, syringes, doctor/nurse administered vaccines, especially in 3rd world countries that are currently being ravaged by COVID. Those countries do not have the infrastructure to administer billions of vaccines and while they try, the virus will be mutating and wreaking havoc that may spread back to first world countries. They will also likely reinforce their vaccine was more thoughtfully designed, as it was planned to attack the spike and N protein which doesn't mutate much. Vaxart's vaccines in theory can have faster distribution, longer lasting protection and equitable access the world over.

Richetti:

Jeff Richetti is Vaxart’s lobbyist. He’s also the brother of Biden’s former Chief of Staff and current Senior Counselor (Biden’s right hand man with full access to Biden and the White House). This gives Vaxart almost direct access to Biden. There’s no one closer to Biden then his Senior Counselor.

The Senior Counselor has a huge role in the WH and has “unrestricted access to the President.”:

“Mr. Ricchetti, 63, has been a key player in Mr. Biden’s life since joining the vice president’s staff in 2012, but his dogged efforts on behalf of a candidate many viewed as past his prime \*\*\*ensured he would have a powerful, free-ranging role in the Biden White House.”

“He is one of the president-elect’s most loyal advisers, and someone Mr. Biden will almost certainly turn to in times of crisis or in stressful moments.

Keep in mind that Vaxart has many connections to the Biden Admin that can possibly help them win a vax dev funding deal or downstream large-scale vax order or even a platform licensing deal for what Vaxart has sometimes referred to as their “The Rapid Pandemic Response Platform”.

These connections include:

\-Dr. David Kessler, Biden’s Covid-19 Response Chief Science Officer is from UCSF 13 miles from Vaxart; UCSF has a vibrant mucosal immunology program. Hard to think they haven’t crossed paths.

\-Ron Klain, Biden Chief of Staff was the former Obama Ebola Czar in 2014-2015 when Vaxart and US Army/US Govt built an Ebola vax pill together and the Army tested it in mice and NHP trials

Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Fox News.”

\-Rick Bright, Biden Covid Advisory Board Member is a Former Obama-era BARDA Director. He led the Influenza division when the BARDA CIADM network was established and when Emergent took over the CIADM that Vaxart is slated to manufacture in. He also led the BARDA  Influenza Division when Vaxart won a $15mln Flu Pill Testing contract from the US Govt and he was Director of BARDA when that contract was later expanded in 2017. He also was director of BARDA when J&J won a big Influenza/Universal Influenza contract (J&J and Vaxart have an early univ flu  collab) and when Emergent expanded the CIADM in 2017.

Market Cap:

Motley has a piece on Vaxart’s potential future market cap - [https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/investing/2021/02/12/what-is-vaxart-worth-now/](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/investing/2021/02/12/what-is-vaxart-worth-now/)

RA Capital sees the market for combo Flu/Covid vaccines as $10-$20BLN/year. If Vaxart can get 20% market share and $2-$4BLN/year in sales they might be looking at a market cap of $20BLN-$40BLN at a 10x price-to-sales ratio and that excludes other pipeline programs, long-term government contracts for vax stockpiling or platform licensing, and potential biopharma licensing deals. This also assumes a low market share % despite a vax pill’s potential to command dominant market share given its distribution advantages in developing nations and the likelihood it achieves higher consumer acceptance rates and vaccination rates due to convenience and a superior customer experience. Governments and people should prefer the pill. It has the potential to make injectables obsolete in the coming years and could lead to possible near-monopoly market share.

**ProbablyStoned contribution**: 

Many of you who have done your research have probably stumbled upon information regarding Vaxart and lawsuits. This can get quite confusing. 

Initially, June 26th, Vaxart released a PR titled ""Vaxart's COVID-19 Vaccine Selected for the U.S. Government's Operation Warp Speed."" Investors mistakenly assumed that automatically meant Vaxart was getting funded or compensated by OWS. However, in the press release, in detail, they explain how they were going to test their pill I'm NHP (primate) studies. Upon reading the PR, Vaxart does not even touch on the subject of funding or compensation. The press release was blunt and straight to the point, as it should be. 

However, the media, somehow mistakenly accidently reported to retailers that ""the company had falsely claimed to be receiving support from Operation Warp Speed."" Shocker! The ambulance chasers of the stock world came running in, and filed an amended complaint alleging that the company issued misleading statements. But….they didn't. Media said they did. They reported falsely….just like the positive p1 results. 

But that's not all, on June 25, 2020, the media said that vaxart partnered with Atwill Medical Solutions to manufacture a billion or more pills per year of the covid vaccine for the US, Europe, and all the other countries in dire need. At the time of the PR, atwill wasn't certified to produce vaccines. This was one day before the OWS PR. Investors of VXRT alleged that this increased the share price nearly by 100%. 

Regarding the June 26th PR, the release noted that Vaxart would be participating in a nonhuman primate challenge study that ""in reality was a tangentially related U.S. government side program,"" the investors claim. BUT, Vaxart was not selected for the U.S. Government's Operation Warp Speed or funding with the NHP studies. By claiming to be 'one of the few companies selected by Operation Warp Speed' at a time when the identities of the remaining two or three pharmaceutical companies actually selected were still a secret yet to be revealed to the public, defendants again materially misled the market,"" according to the amended complaint, which states that Vaxart's share price surged another 28% on the news.

The last issue was the insider trading misconception that occurred between Vaxart and Armistice Capital. Armistice during this time while the stock price increased astronomically to sell 27 million shares of VXRT for about $267M. A month after this, the NYTimes published an article which reported that vaxart was NOT part of the OWS initiative, causing the share price to decrease 10%. Soon after, on August 19, Moncef Slaoui reported that some companies has “misled shareholders by tying themselves to OWS in order to drive up their share price, he was referring to Vaxart. This led the stock to drop another 5%. 

Vaxart responded to the June 25th and June 26th claims about OWS. The company said that investors had MISCHARACTERIZED the June 25/26 PRs. 

Regarding the Atwill part, “the first press release was a forward-looking statement that reflected Vaxart's ""'intent to establish \[Attwill\] as a resource for … manufacturing' its vaccine, if and when the vaccine was successfully developed.""

Regarding the OWS announcement, the PR was 100% transparent. The PR stated that Vaxart has been selected to participate in NHP studies funded by OWS. Vaxart replied, “it can't be accused of fraud just because the release didn't explain that participating in the study didn't mean Vaxart was receiving federal funding for its vaccine development. Nowhere in the 58-page \[amended complaint\] is there a single Vaxart statement that hints at its receipt of federal compensation,"" the company argued, asking that the claims be DISMISSED. 

Armistice Capital is also seeking dismissal of the lawsuit, stating the fact that Armistice had less than a 10% stake in the company on June 25th, and that Armistice just simply was realizing gains, not inside trading. 

""In the face of these straightforward facts — an investor buying low and selling high — plaintiffs manufactured an alleged 'pump-and-dump' scheme premised on statements Vaxart never made,"" the hedge fund said. ""This story is patently false.""

Both Vaxart and Armistice Capital are calling for a dismissal of the lawsuit. The final

Anyway I was never educated about stds and shit can someone help me she is the highest body count lass ive chilled with, 

Saturday night to Monday morning had sex raw with a girl who has 100 bodies and 4? sugar daddies (she just got bk from miami)

But 

--- From my understanding if someone has: \_\_\_ thne its % of catching it per sex? we fucked like 10 times and head like 15 times

  
Herpes 2-4% per sex? (didnt see any bumps)

HPV 85% of catching any hpv variant she may have? hpv leads to genital warts for years (if they go away), and increased cancer risk.

HIV i dont think ill catch the from PIV/ oral/ 1 anal to her so 0%

chlymida/syhpillis ? (fixable) 

am i missing any her lips looked fine, her teeth are starting to crack and get poor from her drugs/grindings, (Dr. said recently she has hole in her nose from coke, she has od 3 time), pussy/ass didnt smell rlly or look bad no bumps from my sight.

"Has anyone seen my previous posts? My HPV GW has been completely gone since this treatment. Open discussion below.. Hi everyone... Dr Arani in LA has a “new” treatment. He destroys the surface wart, and then destroys what is left under the skin - of every single visible gw. Once he does this, they do not grow back. It’s been 2 1/2 years for me... I really can’t suggest this treatment enough..

I’m reposting this because I want as many people to see it as possible. I am just a patient, not connected with Arani in anyway.

What I can say is he is a good person that will tell it to you straight. 

His treatment is expensive, but I promise you it was the only thing that worked for me...

I’ll stop reposting this if a moderator wants me to. 

But guys, go to Dr Arani’s website, or call him by phone to ask your questions.

I have to be honest that was probably the darkest time of my life.. I had about 80, and he removed every single one. My weeny is clean as a whistle these days..

He suggests you get the HPV vacccine as soon as possible, and to not smoke cigarettes. 

He wrote several books on HPV and you can learn a lot from him. His book is called “HPV the silent intruder”, or something like that.

Goodluck everybody. I’m really rooting for you!"	1
"Gyno keeps saying my tests will come back fine and they never do! Now I'm terrified for my LEEP results. In February I went to the gyno to get my birth control reupped. They said I didn't need a pap smear because I'd had one within three years and never an abnormal result. I asked if I could have one anyway because I'd had HPV in the past and it made me nervous. They said it was really not needed but they'd go ahead and do one early since I asked. They said it was very unlikely they'd find anything. Result: LSIL, HSIL cannot be ruled out

So I'm shocked, but go ahead and get a colposcopy just to be safe. Again they said I didn't really need a colposcopy, I could just wait and have another pap down the road and see if it clears up on its own. I asked to go ahead just to be safe. My gyno says my cervix looks great and she's just taking a few tiny samples as a precaution but I'm probably fine. Says they almost certainly won't find anything concerning and any LSIL will probably be removed just from the colposcopy itself. Result: CIN1 and HSIL cannot be ruled out.

Once again, I'm told it is probably nothing and I can just wait and keep an eye on it by getting colposcopies and paps regularly. I asked for a LEEP and they agreed to it but basically said I'm fine and they won't find anything worrying.

I'm so nervous now because every step of this process they've said I didn't need the tests and procedures and I was fine and it was probably nothing. And every time ""Surprise! It's abnormal and we have no idea how advanced it is!""

Has anyone else had a result of ""high-grade lesions cannot be excluded"" on their pap and colpop? Wondering what the chances are of another surprise abnormal result."	0
"Am I being rational when I say I don't need COVID vaccine? Ok, so are these facts true:

The highest the hospitalization rate has been for COVID was 20.6/100,000 in January 2021, or a 0.02% chance you will be hospitalized? Am I reading that right? [https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/COVIDNet/COVID19\_3.html](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/COVIDNet/COVID19_3.html) For my age group its 14.3/100,000 or 0.01%

Mortality rates are in the 0.3-0.5% range? [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7895917/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7895917/) (facts on this are hard to find).

For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, onaverage, there were 2.9 additional conditions or causes per death. [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/health\_policy/covid19-comorbidity-expanded-12092020-508.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/health_policy/covid19-comorbidity-expanded-12092020-508.pdf)

8/10 people that are hospitalized/die from COVID are obese?

Your body produces a long lasting, natural immunity to COVID-19 after infection.

I have a greater chance of getting someone pregnant after my vasectomy than I do of dying from COVID and I can tell you I go bareback 100% the time and don't even think about it.

If these facts are true, can you see why I feel like I don't need a vaccine and why I feel completely rational making that decision? I'm a healthy member of a population with very low risk and I trust my body's immune system. In fact, I take almost zero medicine.

I know someone will tell me that the healthiest, youngest, most perfect person ever died of COVID. I'm not denying that or that I could be the 0.01%. I'm asking if I sound unreasonable for wanting to take a wait and see approach to this new vaccine.

If you have arguments why I should get vaccinated I want to discuss them in the comments.

(PS: I am not asking this forum if it's true that I go bareback 100% of the time)"	0
"Long wait but finally clear!!! Little back story, I developed cervical cancer caused by persistent HPV (non 16/18).

I was lucky enough to find my cancer early enough to be treated with surgery only and not have to do chemo or radiation.

I am 4 months post op and recently had my first smear to kick off my 5 years of post treatment surveillance.. and I am negative for all oncogenic types of HPV and no evidence of CIN 1/2/3 or malignancy ?????? what a relief to be completely clear!

"Week 8 RING THAT BELL! - 53/M Stage 2 SCC Left tonsil & 2 lymph HPV+ Finished 7 of 7 chemo treatments (2 Cisplatin, 5 Carboplatin). Finished 35 of 35 Radiation Treatments!

For those still in treatment or haven't started. yes, ringing the bell might be corny, but for me it was such a feeling of accomplishment. I get that its not for everyone but if you're on the fence, DO IT! 

Let the recovery begin but I know it will take time. I'm still in bed 15-20 hours a day and get very winded just walking up a flight of stairs. Throat hasn't improved any yet so its a struggle to drink my protein shakes but am force myself. Ice water hurts but room temperature isn't too bad so making sure I drink water constantly. I was fortunate where I was able to get some fluids during my last chemo treatment so that gave me a boost. 

I'm hoping to add in some soups this week so I can get back towards eating solid foods again. Nutritionist says no rush as long as I get my protein shakes in she is ok with it. I've lost a ton of weight (fortunately I had plenty to lose) and am down 60 pounds.

I don’t give a shit about Trump’s supposed transgressions with supposed ‘classified documents’, for the mere fact that these pieces of trash are still forcing a useless and bogus vaccine on people as young as 4 years old. You can argue policy all day, but the fact that I’ll need to pay to send my kid to private school unless I inject my kid with their useless bullshit is all I need to know.

"Do excess deaths show a correlation with vaccination (and mandates) rates? Not really. [Some](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/ustfli/the_spike_in_vaccinations_for_ages_2544_lead_to_a/) here have tried [multiple](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/ul50t7/comment/i7t7pth/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) times to show and argue that excess deaths ""spiked"" when vaccinations rates were high and the mandates also helped drive this.

They will argue ""*There were no lockdowns in the U.S during July 2021, so you can’t cite that.*"" and ""*You also can’t blame Delta because you’re essentially admitted the vaccine didn’t protect those people.*""

What they obviously didn't do is do their own research.  Just copied some narrative they had read somewhere and didn't do due diligence.

This is what they want you to see (while hiding the deep dive):

[Misinformation](https://preview.redd.it/asje8h7dq7491.jpg?width=2490&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1105736b51e8be60b8bdfdb9dd7458d3151d9868)

The following is the data when broken down.

**Low vaccination rate states** and their excess deaths, showing overall and 25-44 age range.

**High vaccination rate states** and their excess deaths, showing overall and 25-44 age range.

[Maryland on the charts.](https://preview.redd.it/mkcxev1vq7491.jpg?width=2490&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8bcd5fc35edfcdf017be8f3cdde4da0ed4b32e5)

This same pattern follows for other states.

**Low vaccination rate states had extremely high (off the chart) excess deaths**, particularly through that period some people talk about.  Some would argue it was caused by vaccination and vaccine mandates while others would point to this period lining up with Delta.

**High vaccination rate states had much lower excess deaths**.  Some not much higher than normal range.

If vaccines were the cause of excess deaths then we would see excess deaths higher in states with high vaccination, but we don't.  We see the opposite.  The hypothesis looks to be extremely weak.

"Stage 0 penile cancer (HPV 16) - Timeline and misdiagnosis As there aren´t many posts here on diagnosed penile cancer, I thought I´d share my timeline and experiences with HPV-induced early-stage penile cancer. I am writing this as I hope it encourages people to go get the HPV vaccine (Gardasil), even if you´re not young. It is also an exercise for me as I never really processed this all too well and a reminder to advocate for your health as this took a year of misdiagnosis and doctor visits to resolve. 
  

  
Stats before diagnosis: Male, late 20s, EU, uncircumcised, tobacco user, no other notable medical history
  

  
**Timeline:** 
  

  
**Winter-spring 2021 (probably even earlier):** 
  
I am noticing dry skin under my foreskin for a very long time which does not go away. Some swelling of the foreskin sporadically. As the dry skin sheds when touching it, the skin is red and a bit sore underneath. I call my GP thinking this must be fungus. GP prescribes anti-fungal pills. 
  

  
Weeks later the issue is not resolved, and I talk to my doctor again. Another round of anti-fungal pills. Pharmacist looks weird at me getting all these anti-fungal pills for my penis. No change in symptoms.   

  
**August 2021:** Condition is the same, but now I have a small “cut” in the string under the head of the penis as well. Go to GP who sends me to a urologist. A few weeks later, urologist has a look. He prescribes a steroid cream. The skin is less dry as it is a cream, but soreness and cut persists. 
  

  
**September 2021:** New visit at GP – who now sends me to a new urologist. Urologist thinks this is Herpes. Takes a Herpes test – comes back negative a few weeks later. 
  

  
**October 2021:** Penis is even more red underneath the foreskin, cut persists. A tiny amount of discomfort due to the sore skin. New GP visit - who now doesn’t know what to do. Suggests a sexual health clinic. 
  

  
**October 2021:** Sexual health clinic: nurse asks supervising doctor to have a look and I think they decide this is a bacterial infection of some sort. Prescribes potassium permanganate which I am to mix in water in a glass and dip my penis in. Nice. 
  

  
**November 2021:** Same symptoms, a bit worse each month. Back to sexual health clinic. I tell them that this has been getting worse on for a long time now and they answer “you´re just getting a bit worried, that’s all”. New round of penis-dipping potassium mix for me. Nice.
  

  
**December 2021:** I am getting tired of dipping my penis in a cup all the time for no reason. Also, it can’t be a super rare cancer I read about that mostly men over 50 get, right? Wife firmly  
  
tells me to go to a dermatologist. Derm wants to do a biopsy. Derm gives me a new cut and penis-stiches. Nice. Strict order of no more medical penis-dipping. 
  

  
**Jan 2022:** Biopsy comes back, HPV 16 induced squamous cell carcinoma stage 0 (dysplasia, PeIN III). Which to me after reading up means one more step and it might spread. 
Anxiety!  

  
**Feb 2022:** Hospital doc asks if I want a cream which in some cases does not remove all cancerous cells. The alternative is circumcision. I ask the doc what he would do, and we decide on the circumcision. Anxiety turns up as I am scared that it spreads before they operate.
  

  
**Feb 2022:** Circumcised under anesthesia and cancer cell-free. Erections while sleeping are hell. They had to remove lots of skin, but everything looks and works fine two years later. Got the vaccine later even if the hospital doc says it might be “a bit late to the party”.
  

  
I am not followed up by the hospital anymore, no new issues. I still go to the dermatologist to check on things as I (and hopefully, my wife) don’t want to lose more of my penis. Thank you if you read all this and apologies for the long post.

"I'm Torn on the Monkeypox Vaccine Profiling I'm fortunate enough to live in LA county. I've been on prep for years. I qualified to get the Jynneos vax so I went and got it yesterday. However, I feel rather guilty about getting it. I hate how sexually active gay males are being profiled right now, however, it's obvious this is spreading like wildfire through the community.   


I feel like I should have waited until this was available to the general public so I could do my part to not enable the profiling. However, people were cruising Grindr literally standing in line for the shot. I hate to say it, but I feel like the profiling is justified. I participate in casual sex just like anyone else, but jesus effing christ sometimes moderation is warranted.  


I'm truly torn on if health agencies are handling this correctly by the profiling. Curious of everyone else's thoughts."	0
Im 20 and a guy lied to me and gave me hpv. So I was talking to a guy and thing we’re going good.  Im in college and ofc in college hookup culture is pretty common. We ended up hooking up but before all that I asked about sexual health and said I only use condoms. I was honest about everything, I didnt have anything. I already knew something was up because after i left i saw that he blocked me on the dating app and i lost contact with him. Soon I found out he lied to me about his sexual health bc I started immediately getting hpv symptoms. I went to a doctor and he confirmed it was hpv. I was so angry because I was honest and he wasnt, he lied to me. On top of that we used a condom, and I still got it. Now im all alone going through this, dont have any friends that have this std and I dont know anyone in college that has it either. I feel like im the only 20 year old who is now stuck with hpv and has to live with it forever. I guess im writing on here for a pep talk, or something to make me believe things will be alright.	1

Can you be positive for High Risk HPV via oral or anal path after clearing it vaginally? Has anyone had experience testing for oral or anal HPV after clearing vaginal HPV 16 or 18? I guess we can also expand to any high risk HPV but usually you won't know which one you have.  So my question is whether you can still be positive for HR HPV via oral or anal pathway after clearing it vaginally via LEEP or otherwise.	0
"Looking for advice/evidence I am not looking to be attacked. I have always been pro vaccine and a strong believer in science. However, after having a baby, vaccines just seem scary. After having the Covid vaccine, I was almost hospitalized and I permanently have a swollen lymph node in my left armpit and the doctors are concerned but won’t imagine until I’m done breast feeding. 

We have severe autism in my family. My grandpa was undiagnosed but definitely was. I personally believe that the majority of my mother’s family is and I have cousins that are very severe (can not care for themselves). My son has been vaccinated through 6 months. I am aware that vaccines don’t cause autism. However, autism is listed as a possible side effect in the vaccine inserts? From what it seems like, autism is genetic and then vaccines can be the environmental trigger? I’m just so confused. I work with high needs severely autistic kids that are locked in. 

Also, everyone says vaccines can’t kill you but how does that explain the families that have kids they take home after a vaccine and never wake up after they go to sleep. 

Does encephalitis possibly cause brain damage and therefore the vaccine didn’t directly cause autism, but it cause encephalitis which can present similarly to autism? 

There are studies out there that state that we don’t truly know the safety of heavy metals in vaccines. 

I would appreciate anyone’s resources. I’m just a scared mom and after watching my cousins regress literally right after they had their vaccines, I’m scared for my child. "	0
"How does autopsy reveal whether the vaccine shot is linked to a suspect death? Europe is facing some cases of thrombolytic events happened shortly after AZ jab (22 cases in 3 millions)

Among the observations that scientists have been making, there is that such statistics does not show anomalies as thrombosis happens on an even higher frequency regardless. 

In Italy, two deaths are currently being investigated, and the autopsy did not confirm yet that either blood clots have played a role (a policeman and a soldier died of cardiac arrest days after vaccination though they didn't have known pre-existing conditions) or the vaccine did in other ways, or a third yet unknown condition. 

I am not obviously asking regarding the AZ vaccine specifically, nor the deaths in Europe. But since we expect illnesses and/or deaths to happen even in short time in a sufficiently big population, how would an autopsy *prove* a link with the vaccine? 

If other pre-conditions or visible diseases are found out, the physicians can rule out the vaccine's role. 

But had even (by assumption) the vaccine done the harm, the question is, how would the physicians find out during the autopsy? What sign would in some way demonstrate that? Beyond allergic reaction. 

I am curious since, well, the autopsies exist to explore and find out the cause of a death per person, unlike the statistics that can explore abnormal mortalities with many subjects"	0

"Interestingly it looks like Malone wasn't the inventor of mRNA vaccines that he claims to be. Very dubious claim when you research it. It's more akin to Clive Sinclair claiming he invented Windows as he made the ZX Spectrum a popular home computer.

He did initial RNA vaccine research as well as RNA gene therapy research and explained how it could be done but never managed to actually pull it off and never tested it even in animals and got stuck with the RNA being destroyed before it could reach target cells.

A Hungarian scientist did a lot of the work to get where we are today including the protection to allow it to survive.

"Persistent High-Risk HPV Hope Hi, everyone! I just wanted to share some good news for anyone who is struggling with worry or fear regarding persistent HPV. I was diagnosed 5 years ago with non 16/18 high-risk HPV along with ASCUS/LSIL. After checkups every six months, 4 colposcopy procedures, and no changes, I had begun to accept this may never improve. After all, I was well past the “two-year mark.”

I recently received the call from the doctor (almost ignored it, LOL, because I thought it would once again be bad news) that my results were finally normal. Yes, even after five years it can and does clear. Do not give up hope! While I tried AHCC, many vitamins, vegan diet, and researched everything under the sun, etc., none of those things worked for me. It simply took time and was a lesson in patience and the importance of physical AND mental health. 

I wanted to share that it is absolutely possible to heal. Best wishes to you all. :)"	0
"Feeling down about having HPV? Read this! Hi all,

Recently, there have been some posts on this sub about people who feel upset about having HPV. HPV can be an unpleasant experience for many, so I thought I would share some tips on how to feel better once you have a HPV infection.

**Remember that HPV infections are usually temporary**

90% of HPV infections clear within two years (and you can see the posts on my profile or the pinned posts by r/xdhpv for sources on this). That means that, statistically, you are very, very likely to clear the virus. How long will it take, on average? Take a look at this [table](https://imgur.com/a/ajTbpWo). For those with genital warts, you can see that the majority of low-risk HPV infections clear within the year. For those with high-risk HPV infections, look at the studies using the links I have provided to check the average clearance time.

**'I feel so dirty'**

You wouldn't feel dirty if you got a wart on your hand or foot. So how is it any different when you get it on your genitals?

One of the reasons why I dealt with having HPV so well was because a few years ago, I had a verruca on my foot. At the time I remember thinking that it was a bit gross and slightly embarrassing, in the same way it's a bit gross and slightly embarrassing whenever I get a pimple on my face, or some ringworm on my leg - but I just left it alone and it went away by itself in time. In the same way, getting genital warts is a bit gross and slightly embarrassing, but it's certainly no reason to feel ashamed or dirty! You will get through it.

**'I'm scared that it will affect my dating and sex life'**

There is naturally no hard and fast science on this, but my experience - both in my personal life and from reading stories online - is that people tend to be fine with dating someone with HPV, because they can simply get vaccinated against it. I continued to date people as normal whilst having an HPV infection, and met my now-boyfriend on there. About a month into dating, just when it seemed like things were going to get physical, I asked if my boyfriend if he'd been vaccinated for HPV and calmly explained that I currently had an HPV infection so it would be good if he could get vaccinated. He said, 'OK.' And that was that.

And there are tons of other stories like this! I read a recent post about someone who was terrified to tell his new girlfriend about his condition. I encouraged him to tell her and you know what he said afterwards? 'It went really well and it's brought us closer together.'

Obviously, be sensible in how you disclose. If you tell someone before you even meet them, or act like Lupin from Harry Potter ('Who'd want to marry a *werewolf?!'*) then people might understandably be put off. But handle it well and if someone likes you, it won't matter.

**Consider taking steps to boost your immune system**

With HPV, you just have to wait and let your immune system do its thing. But sometimes, taking active steps to help fight your infection can make you feel better. There is some evidence to suggest that supplements like oral zinc and AHCC can help clear HPV more quickly (but always check for possible side effects). More generally, you can help boost your immune system by eating a healthy diet, exercising and getting plenty of sleep.

**Consider seeing a therapist**

If you're finding things hard, you might consider looking into psychosexual counselling. Some people find it hard to discuss having HPV with friends and family. Talking to a therapist can help with that.

Finally, read the pinned post, in particular the part about keeping your mental health during an HPV infection."	1
"From Vaccine Virgin to Mpox Maverick: My Wild Ride into the World of Vaccines Alright, Reddit, buckle up. I've always been that guy, the one who never got vaccinated. Not because I was scared, but because, well, I was perfectly healthy. Like, Superman levels of health. No colds, no flus, just pure, unadulterated human perfection.

The Backstory:

- Vaccine Virgin: Yep, you read that right. Never. Not once. Not even a flu shot. My body, my temple, and I was the high priest.

- The Perfect Health Paradox: ""Why fix what ain't broke?"" was my motto. I could outrun any sickness, or so I thought.

- The Mpox Madness: Then came mpox, with its shiny new clade 1b variant. Suddenly, my fortress of solitude seemed less like a bastion of health and more like a lonely, vulnerable island.

The Unhinged Epiphany:

- The Dark Web of Information: I went down rabbit holes that would make conspiracy theorists blush. From fringe forums to obscure scientific papers, I was on a quest not just for truth, but for survival.

- The Reddit Factor: That's when I found it, a post on Reddit.  Some random guy, probably morbidly obese and living in his mom's basement, had a revelation about vaccines that made me pause. ""Vaccines are like cheat codes for your immune system,"" he said.

- The Decision: In a moment of sheer, unhinged clarity, I decided, ""Why not?"" If the world was going to throw viruses at me like a cosmic game of dodgeball, I needed armor.

The Shot Heard 'Round My Life:

I walked into the clinic like a man possessed. The nurse looked at me like I was an alien. ""You've never been vaccinated? At all?""

- The First Jab: That needle went in, and I swear, I felt my body go, ""What the heck is this?""

- The Mpox Vaccine: Then came the mpox shot. Now, I was officially part of the vaccinated club, but not just any club, the elite resistance fighters against a global outbreak.

Why I'm Now a Vaccine Evangelist:

- The Invincibility Illusion: Turns out, my ""perfect health"" was a house of cards. One bad day, one mutant virus, and I could've been toast.

- The Community Angle: Vaccines aren't just about me; they're about us. I'm now a shield, not just for myself, but for every grandma, every kid, every human I cross paths with.

- The Science Is Lit: From being a skeptic to a believer, the science behind these vaccines is like magic if magic was real, provable, and saved lives.

The Conclusion:

Reddit, if a guy who was never vaccinated, who prided himself on never needing them, can come around, maybe there's hope for everyone. Vaccines are like the ultimate plot armor in this wild game of life.

So, here I am, unhinged with enthusiasm, preaching the gospel of vaccines. From a vaccine virgin to a mpox maverick, my life's taken a turn. And you know what? It feels like I've unlocked a new level of existence.

Stay safe, stay wild, and maybe, just maybe, get vaccinated. It's a wild ride.

Why everybody should get vaccinated? The longer this pandemic last, the more people catch it, the more chance that more deadly, contagious variants would arise. So far the Pfeizer or Moderna vaccines are still valid against all known variants, but nobody can guarantee this for all future variants. British variant, South Africa variant, or the delta variant were caused by the lack of vaccines at the time or place, but if a deadly variant occur here in the USA, or any other countries with adequate vaccine supply, it will largely the antivaxxers faults. At this time the whole world is still short on vaccine supply, hence vaccine hesitance does not pose as a global problem. What you refuse to take will end up in somebody else's arm. Once we have enough doses to innoculate everyone on the planet, refusing to get vaccinated becomes an anti humanity offense.	1
"Why you shouldn't worry about recurrences after you clear your infection I've been seeing some people get hung up on Doorbar's presentation, feeling like they can never consider themselves free of HPV even after they clear their infections. I wrote a comment about my views on this and I thought it might help some people so I'm posting it here:

""There's still some controversy surrounding Doorbar's idea of viral latency. If you ask me, Doorbar really seems to be making the claim that latency is a thing that can and does happen, but not necessarily that it happens in every instance of infection. If you look at the flowchart from Gravitt he presents, it suggests multiple different pathways the virus can take, with latency being one option and eradication being another. Gravitt says so herself when she says in her paper ""A key question in the natural history of HPV infections *in the individual* is whether a cleared infection is truly cleared or latent."" If the claim was ALL infections go latent, it wouldn't be a matter of what an infection does in the individual, but in the population as a whole.

Another point is that Doorbar says that they could ""rather consistently"" detect HPV virus particles in bits of skin where lesions regressed (remember that even in these bits of skin, new lesions didn't form when the rabbits were given heavy immunosuppressants). Well, how common is ""rather consistently?"" Clearly it's not all. Gravitt uses similar phrasing (""Redetection of same HPV type is *relatively common*"") to describe 10-20% of infections reactivating over the course of one's life.

This is further backed up by the fact that if all infections only become immune-controlled and thus the only thing keeping these infections from producing lesions is our immune system, then we'd see 100% prevalence of lesions among the elderly because 100% of people become infected with HPV and all elderly people undergo immune senescence. We do see a slight uptick in HPV prevalence among the elderly, but far from 100%.

Basically, it seems to me that these researchers aren't claiming that all infections become latent, just that not all of them totally clear. I've actually looked more into Doorbar's research, and that spiel he gave in the pinned video isn't news to the HPV researcher community. A while back I found a video of him giving essentially the same presentation over 10 years ago, and yet most researchers still agree that once someone ""clears"" their infection (despite not really being able to know if they have), they shouldn't continue to consider themselves a carrier of the virus because for most people their infection will never become active again or transmissable.""

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And regardless of whether or not infections *can* be eradicated fully (I believe they can), the fact remains the vast majority who clear them won't have recurrences and that immune-controlled infections have little distinction from total clearance.

I'll also add that if you take Gravitt's 10-20% figure (keeping in mind that this applies to high-risk strains, so the figure is probably lower for low-risk strains which have less immune-evasion properties) at face value, you're still looking at a figure that applies primarily to the elderly and those with immune-compromised conditions. Keep in mind that most people will get cancer if they live long enough. You're literally more likely to get cancer than you are to have a recurrence after achieving viral clearance. More will develop heart disease.

My point is, even if you are part of the 10-20% who will experience a recurrence many years after achieving viral clearance, chances are you'll have worse things to worry about by that point. This isn't meant to increase your anxiety, but rather to try and alleviate it by pointing to all the other terrible things that could potentially happen to you that you don't waste energy worrying about. If these things which make HPV look cute don't plague your mind, then neither should HPV live rent free in your head after you clear it. The only difference is that you've already had a direct experience with HPV, whereas it's easier to pretend these other conditions are so far removed from us because we have yet to have direct experience with them. Keep in mind more people have asymptomatic HPV infections than symptomatic, so in reality everyone has a chance to have an activation of HPV regardless of if they've had symptoms before, but again most people don't worry about it because it's easy to pretend it's far removed from them if they've never had symptoms.

I'll end this rant by focusing on this final point. One thing I appreciate about my own experience with HPV is that it really forced me to confront existential matters. Most here are presumably young folks because HPV spreads the most around young people. For many here, this may be our first brush with a ""long-term"" condition. Young people are prone to feeling invincible, knowing they're not but not really ""feeling"" their vulnerability. They take their comfort for granted. For them, HPV is probably their first time feeling the potential for the bottom to drop out, and for life to be able to change at the drop of a hat. While this can be distressing, it can also be a source of appreciation. It serves as a reminder to take nothing for granted in life and that it behooves us to maintain a posture of psychological flexibility to the many twists and turns that can happen in life. If we remain rigidly attached to a vague plan for how our lives *should* unfold, we're setting ourselves up to be devastated should those plans not be realized, and they frequently are not realized. I recently learned this on a Buddhist forum where a 28-year-old man was diagnosed with ALS and now discovered his life will be much shorter and more painful than he anticipated.

All this to say that if you clear your infection, do us all a favor and take the money and run. Don't continue trying to convince yourself to remain worried and anxious when plenty here would call you lucky. Otherwise, you may as well fill your mind up with worries over all the other bad things that can happen to you. It's not necessarily a bad thing to acknowledge these possibilities. As I said, it's good to engage with the existential from time to time so we don't take the good things we have for granted, but it is a bad thing to constantly ruminate on it and let it disturb your peace of mind."	0

I got sent to emergency care to immediately get spine tapped, blood tested, scanned, ETC. i got tested all day because of my parents old mistakes. During this time my PO finds out (Petty Officer) not parole officer, and she also starts freaking out because i leave soon. Now i have 3 more follow ups and some large co pays to deal with. please vaccinate your kids. 	1
"What if I just want safer, more effective vaccines? What if I feel that they're not as safe as they should be, and want to find out how unsafe they are.. or that some are not necessary and only make things worse? Why is my opinion so pseudo scientific, a crazy Karen conspiracy? Why should I get done for murder? Why am I crazy? 

What if I just think that the vaccine schedules aren't as good or as safe as they should be? 

I'm pro life, let's work together and make it so that vaccines ARE the best medical invention! What if I think that it's a good invention but not carried out in the best way.

What if I think we aren't doing our best? 

What if I think we aren't be skeptical enough?

The last time an open mind, honest inquiries, and sincere questions rarely contributed to negative outcomes.

The worst that could happen is you find out that everything's good and how it should be!?

"Is HPV the same as cervical cancer? So I just got into a huge argument with my boss, a MD at a cancer hospital in a developing country regarding hpv and cervical cancer. 

Allow me to paint the picture: we are working on a grant submission on communicable diseases. The focus is hpv prevention but she wants to focus on cervical cancer, bu I’m adamant that the grantor won’t even review our submission if it’s on cervical cancer. She says to just trust her and don’t argue with her because she’ll escalate it to the medical director and get me fired.

She claims that hpv is the same as cervical cancer as hpv is the major risk factor in 80% to 99.7% of all cases of cervical cancer. My argument is that they’re not the same. Preventing hpv through vaccination and educating patients on safe sex and contraceptive use is not the same as preventing cervical cancer. CDC says that it’s the major risk factor, but hpv infection does not mean a person has cervical cancer. I said that correlation does does mean causation and she says yes it does.

So here I am, on my last straw, on reddit at 6 am asking scientists: is hpv the same as cervical cancer?"	0
"how do i interpret a negative HPV test after years of having it? hi all! 
i have had HPV for many years in my 20s (i’d say definitely since 23 until almost 30). i moved countries in that time period so was exposed to different approaches to it. i never had LEEP, but had several biopsies. they told me i had mostly CIN 1 and apparently lt a tiny bit of CIN 2 that they then thought they removed completely with one of the biopsies. the last i was told was by a letter after one of the biopsies (where they also took a pap test, as i understand) that said i tested negative for HPV and do not need to do anything for a few years. i guess that’s an encouragement for those who still have it here!

my issue is that the letter doesn’t go into details so i’m wondering what it really means for me. does it mean it “cleared up”? has my immune system suppressed it? do i need to be worried about transmitting it to an unvaccinated partner? can i get vaccinated to avoid picking up other strains? none of the doctors i’ve been treated by ever told me what types i have but i assume they’re the cancerous ones if they did biopsies so worried about transmission and reappearance. what people here do after a negative test?

is my ex-partner at risk of developing oral/other kind of cancer? should i tell them to be cautious? he knows about my HPV but i don’t think knows much about it."	0
"Should u really get it done First and foremost- I am not in any way dismissing the importance of being proactive and taking precautionary steps  when it comes to cancer. BUT. Hear me out. Long story short-ish and then I'll get to my point. August 21st I had a colposcopy biopsy done (2). They attempted an endometrial biopsy but almost kicked obgyn guy in the face. Was rushed out I felt. A week later after being stuck in bed with pain, and a severe ""balloon""  feeling in there ( almost like u put a super tampon too far in and left it, Ugh) I was in the e.r telling them somethings wrong. After my 2nd pelvic exam at the e.r they decided I had an infection from the biopsy and a lot of inflammation. Was put on doxycycline and diclofenac. A couple days later, got my results. Pre cancerous cells. I can't remember the exact specifics. I had a panic attack. Not at the thought of it being pre cancer (well, a little) but MOSTLY because they recommended a Leep procedure. I'm sobbing, telling them that I don't think I can go through something like this again. I've had to use so much paid leave bc my work is strenuous and heavy lifting. Bleeding started after the e.r pelvic exam too, which had not previously occurred so I was losing my mind. I called and talked to the obgyn crying and freaking out that I didn't want anyone or anything going back up in me. I am traumatized and still in recovery from what should have been a simple biopsy. He said, (and this is where I finally collect myself and want to cry out of joy) "" I cannot say for sure, but it's a very small area, and it's possible that I removed it all just with the biopsy. Seeing as it's caused you so much pain and discomfort, I don't see why an option wouldn't be to keep making pap appointments and keep an eye on your cells, if they're still even there"" I wanted to do a happy dance but I couldn't bc I still hurt lol okay to the point. The more I educate myself...the more I'm finding info on most of these precancerous cells disappearing when the hpv virus has cleared. Which can take 2 years or longer. Only 10 to 20% even become cancerous. And ive had gardasil as a teen so that protects me slightly more.So, why are all of these women subjected to barbaric torture and potentially unnecessary procedures? It can take 7 to 10 YEARS for those cells to turn into cancer. I just don't understand it. Its like as soon as they see something thats normal with hpv they're just like ""cut it out, then wait and see) They could remove these cells and they could just come right back! I just thank my obgyn (even though he butchered me the first time) for considering that to do nothing might be best. With that said, now it's on ME. Ive already quit smoking when i got my hpv diagnosis last year. I have to quit vaping. I have to get off of nicotine for good. I'm eating the healthiest I've ever eaten and haven't had a soda in 2 1/2 weeks. I have to get my immunity up so my body can clear this. If you take anything from this super long (sorry) rant, please let it be that you will advocate for yourself and talk to your doctors. Make yourself very clear. Research and get yourself healthy. You got this, no matter what route you decide, you got this."	-1
Low risk HPV but CIN3?? So I am awaiting my LEEP procedure tomorrow. The past few years I’ve had Pap smears coming back positive for a low risk strain and both doctors have stressed to me that it’s not a big deal and come back in a year. After the 3rd year of it not going away they decided to send me for a colposcopy. Which to my shock, and my gyno’s shock came back with CIN3 high grade cell changes. She told me that she was also not expecting those results. At not one point have I been told I am positive for high risk and I also have been vaccinated in high school.  I just don’t understand how this is possible since I’m only in my early to mid twenties and have only ever been told I have low risk hpv. That it was so common and my doc even likened it to “a cold of the cervix”. She made it seem like it’s not a big deal at all. It seems that instead of my body clearing jt like it was expected too, it got worse and only in a few years. Has anyone else experienced this? I have heard that the contraceptive pill can increase likelihood of hpv changing and I feel like that maybe that could explain it a little because I have been on it for a very long time. I don’t know, I’m just shocked and confused. And now scared what they are going to find in the LEEP	0
"CDC Vaccine Schedule Recommendations VS. legal requirements to vaccinate child ?? Confused Good morning, 

I am going to be a first time mom in March. I am calling around to pediatricians and one of the first questions they ask is ""are you going to be compliant with the CDC's vaccination schedule?"" It has taken me by surprise since I thought that the CDC schedule is a ""recommendation."" I looked up the state requirements (live in NJ) and there are vaccination requirements starting at Prek, which was a much shorter list....but I guess I'm hoping someone can clarify what is legally required? I am okay with some vaccines, but others, I really have no interest in giving the baby, such as the Hep B vaccine that is transmitted by unprotected sex and IV drug use (we've got bigger issues if the baby is at risk here!). I am a bit concerned that I'll be able to find a pediatrician that is willing to work with me on a modified schedule. Any thoughts or advice is appreciated!"	0
"HPV Prevalence Megapost Hi everyone. I have been meaning to write this post for a while, because we sometimes get people posting things like this:

* It can't be true that everyone has/has had HPV
* HPV is not normal
* I don't know anyone who has had HPV
* Big Pharma is just trying to normalise HPV so we all get it and they make money
* Doctors are just trying to make us feel better because we are disgusting freaks who deserve to be celibate forever or maybe just DIE ALONE!!!1!!!ONE

I wanted to make a post to collect as much of the evidence as possible so I could easily respond to such queries. There is probably loads more to add, and please do post other studies in the comments. For now:

**DISCLAIMERS:** I am not a doctor or a virologist.

**Understanding prevalence is also not an absolutely exact science**, for a number of reasons. As you'll see when I go through some of the evidence, our understanding of HPV prevalence comes from a few sources:

* Population sampling - this will involve taking samples from a selection of people, sometimes randomly selected, or sometimes people who have come into clinics or surgeries for other reasons. Obviously, the latter can introduce some bias. We also need to extrapolate from the sample to the whole population. However, this is a very common method of understanding health issues and other statistics across a population, as it's not practical to sample every single person.
* Cervical screening - because in many countries, women and people with cervixes are screened regularly, medical institutions can report on the outcomes.
* Self-reporting to sexual health services for things like warts - these clinics can report their statistics, although of course not everyone with warts will get them treated or even know they are there.
* Surveying - e.g. have you ever had genital warts? - of course, not everyone will be truthful or know that they've had them.
* Blood testing for antibodies aka seroprevalence - this can give some sense of past infections but not everyone makes antibodies, especially men, meaning that it won't capture every case.

Because HPV has so many strains, and can be present in multiple body parts, it's quite difficult to find every single case. Additionally, there is the potential for HPV to reactivate (we don't know loads about it right now); we don't currently have a way to test for latent or dormant infections. So, any study is probably going to miss a certain % of cases.

**How come people in the past didn't have HPV?**

Well, they did...

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8953638/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8953638/)

*Pimenoff et al. showed that HPV16 A and B/C/D variant lineages split apart \~500,000 years before present (YBP), which largely predates the birth of Homo sapiens (\~200,000 YBP) and coincides with the timing of the split between Neanderthals and Homo sapiens*

That's right. HPV has been with us ***before we were homo sapiens***\*\*.\*\*

However, the science of HPV is fairly recent.

[https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/2014/09/16/hpv-the-whole-story-warts-and-all/](https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/2014/09/16/hpv-the-whole-story-warts-and-all/)

HPV 6 and 11 were discovered in the 1980s, followed by 16 and 18. The lead scientist in discovering 16 and 18 and proposing the link with cervical cancer actually won a Nobel prize:

[https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2008/hausen/biographical/](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2008/hausen/biographical/)

In 1999, it was proven that HPV causes almost all cases of cervical cancer. That's within the lifetime of most people on this sub.

Smear tests or 'Pap smears' have been widely used since the 1960s. Before this point, there wasn't a way to discover abnormalities on the cervix before they developed into cancer. It's hard to know how many people died from cervical cancer in the past, but this paper shows the impact of cervical screening.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4958036/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4958036/)

*Pap smears were associated with a reduction of between 105,000 to 492,000 cases of cervical cancer over the past three decades in the U.S.*

HPV testing alongside smears is quite a new introduction, and it's not done everywhere. In my country, the UK, they have only moved to testing every single smear for HPV since 2018 (and smears are only done over age 25, because so many people would test positive below this age). This means that a lot of people who had HPV in the past simply didn't know. In some countries, it's still the case that HPV testing is only done for abnormal smears, or HPV testing may only be done for people over a certain age (e.g. 30 in some parts of the USA).

**How come I don't know anyone with or who has had HPV?**

As we will see, you probably do. But remember that most people simply don't know.

* Most infections are asymptomatic
* People with cervixes are usually only called for cervical smears after a certain age (because they're so likely to test positive before this!)
* Smears may or may not be co-tested for HPV
* Cervical smears only happen every 1-5 years in most places
* Anal smears can be hard to access and are not publicised in a lot of places
* Oral testing isn't commonly done (because it's not very useful)
* There's no practical way to test for external infections without visible symptoms, outside of scientific studies where multiple samples can be taken
* People with penises aren't commonly tested for any form of HPV in most countries

So actually, most people who have or have had HPV **have no idea**.

With that said, onto some stats and studies...

**Lifetime probability**

This is an important study (2019) that looks at the lifetime chance of acquiring genital HPV (although the paper itself does not specify genital, it's clear that's the topic as it is discussing sexual behaviour). This is a modelling exercise, as it's not possible to test a large number of people over their whole lifetime, but is based on data collected from real people. Disclaimer that people who had no opposite-sex partners up to age 44 were excluded.

This is the study that shows that 80% + of people are expected to get HPV by age 45. That does not mean that 80% of people are walking around with HPV right now. It's about your lifetime chance of getting it. This varies slightly depending on whether you've had one or many partners, and you can see many more details in the paper.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6745688/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6745688/)

Key info:

*Under base case assumptions, the average lifetime probability of acquiring HPV was 84.6% for women and 91.3% for men*

*This probability ranged from 58.4% for those in lifetime partner group 1 (1 partner through age 44 years) to 100% (when rounded to nearest 0.1%) for those in lifetime partner group 5 (15 or more partners through age 44 years).*

*Under base case assumptions, more than 80% of women and men acquire HPV by age 45 years.*

*The lifetime probability of acquiring HPV ranged from 23.2% to 75.9% for group 1 (1 partner through age 44 years) and from 98.3% to 100% for group 5 (Q15 partners through age 44 years).*

The study notes that these estimates chime with other studies done through sampling and seroprevalence.

**How many people have genital HPV right now?**

This will depend somewhat on age, location and cohort.

And so on. You can probably do a search to see if there is a study in your own country.

We know that infection rates are higher in younger women in general, e.g.:

[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/20577](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/20577)

*HPV prevalence was 24.5% (95% CI, 19.6%-30.5%) among females aged 14 to 19 years, 44.8% (95% CI, 36.3%-55.3%) among women aged 20 to 24 years, 27.4% (95% CI, 21.9%-34.2%) among women aged 25 to 29 years, 27.5% (95% CI, 20.8%-36.4%) among women aged 30 to 39 years, 25.2% (95% CI, 19.7%-32.2%) among women aged 40 to 49 years, and 19.6% (95% CI, 14.3%-26.8%) among women aged 50 to 59 years.*

But in men this may not be so clear:

[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1054139X1100098X](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1054139X1100098X)

*Peak HPV prevalence spanned a wide range of ages and was generally not concentrated in the younger age groups. Age-specific prevalence curves were relatively flat or declined only slightly following peak prevalence*

**Prevalence of high risk HPV**

Okay, but what about high risk HPV, aka what we are really worried about?

* [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hpv-prevalence-in-sexually-active-young-females-in-england](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hpv-prevalence-in-sexually-active-young-females-in-england) \- this is a very detailed study of HPV prevalence in young women in England. It compares rates of different strains before and after widespread vaccination with Cervarix or G4 were introduced. Before - in ages 22-24, 16.4% had 16/18, 7.8% had 31/33/45, and 31.9% had another high risk type. After Cervarix was introduced, 2.6% had 16/18, 5.1% 31/33/45, and 36.1% other high risk types. We would expect this to change a bit with G9.
* [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8418833](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8418833) \- back to women in Japan - 28.1% of participants had a high risk type, and 16.2% had both low and high risk.

HPV-16 was the most prevalent HPV genotype (5%)*

Other hr-HPV types other than HPV 16 and 18 were predominant, with a prevalence of 10.6%; HPV 18/45 (2.31%), HPV 16 (0.46%), and 3.24% of the study participants had more than one hr-HPV genotype.* 

Again, you can search for your own country/sex/age.

As for who has ever had high risk HPV, we need seroprevalence for this (caveat as before), e.g.:

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4748390/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4748390/)

Mid-life women: *About two-thirds (68.1%) were seropositive for any hrHPV, 15.0% were DNA positive, and 70.7% were seropositive or DNA positive. 71% of mid-adult women had evidence of current or prior hrHPV infection.* 

**How many people get warts?**

* [https://sti.bmj.com/content/95/5/386](https://sti.bmj.com/content/95/5/386) \- UK -  *3.8% and 4.6% of sexually experienced men and women reported ever having a diagnosis of GWs, with 1.3% of men and 1.7% of woman reporting a GWs diagnosis in the past 5 years.*

In addition, 1.3% reported having experienced genital warts within the past 12 months...The data suggest that ?1 in 10 women in the Nordic countries experience genital warts before the age of 45 years*

Struggling to find a paper for the USA but a few website sources say 1%.

We might expect changes after widespread vaccination in some countries.

*By 2018, there had been a 64% reduction in the proportion of all SHC patients with a genital warts diagnosis relative to 2004-2007*

Not everyone with low risk HPV will develop warts. Because low risk HPV isn't part of usual cervical screening, there isn't so much info, but:

Not an anti-vaxxer but worried about covid From what I know of vaccines, they are basically a dead or weakened strain of the disease you are being vaccinated against. That's all fine and good, and I have nothing against traditional vaccines. But the coronavirus vaccines are nothing like those traditional one, as far as I know. Is there anyone like me that think anti-vaxxers are crazy but think the covid vaccines are dubious? Also, would like trusted sources on these new drugs.	0
"Meta has herpes Hi all,

My partner (m43) and I (f36) are fluid bonded. Have been for years, and are both STD-free, save my bout with HPV in my early twenties. He has a lover (f36) with whom he has not slept with yet as they live across the globe from us. However he's planned a trip this month to visit her. It has come to my attention that she is positive for herpes I (HSV1) and has had outbreaks in her ass. He only disclosed this information to me after now after months of knowing this fact. First off, I am hurt that he waited so long to tell me, but that's besides the point. More importantly, I am 100% not ok with him introducing this risk into our relationship. He seems nonchalant about having sex with her and promises to be ""safe."" We've talked about condom use for any (PIV) penetration and being careful not to let her fluids touch any part of his body besides the hands, which he should wash promptly. Overall, I just really don't want them to have sex at all. It is not a risk I'm willing to take, however small the odds are of him catching it and spreading it to me. Also, I don't want to lose him as my partner or primary / fluid bonded person.

&#x200B;

I wonder if you all have any advice on a few things:

1- Is my concern over him catching HSV1 well founded? I am being paranoid?2- Do you ever draw strong boundaries of this sort? Like a sex-veto power?3- How can I react rationally should they decide to be sexually intimate?4- Are dental dams and condom use a reasonable thing for me to ask that they use?

&#x200B;

Thank you for your info and advise. Just trying to feel sane and safe over here..."	0
"Can I get HPV through dry bedsheets, dry towels and faucet? I used hotel dry towels to dry me genital area and sat  (my genital area touch the bedsheet) on bedsheets after having sex w my BF (he's healthy and doesn't have any stds, we always use condoms), we are the first partner of each other and he's faithful. I'm too scared that I will get genital warts so I did an HPV test and the result came back was negative. But I'm still overthinking about GW. I cannot clear my minds. I read lots of articles on many websites and they said that HPV spread through skin-to-skin contact, my doctor agrees with this. But somes said that HPV can spread through towels, bedsheets, faucets, bathrooms, etc.
Are there any one get GW through such a dry things that I mentioned above? Thanks a lot."	0
"<Vent> Whole family lied to me about being vaccinated for months. Now they have Covid. Just need to vent because I’m pretty pissed. I’m immunocompromised so I got vaccinated pretty early in the pandemic. When eligibility came up, my family (except my mom who went full vocal conspiracy theorist) all claimed they got vaccinated. 

Now they’re all sick while I’m not and it came out that there was a deliberate effort to lie to me about their vax status because they were Trump supporters and I wasn’t. So they didn’t think I could be “reasoned with.” 

My mom (who at least didn’t tell me she was vaccinated) went on a Christmas vacation (likely the source of the outbreak in my family) with my sister and a cancer patient who is also unvaxxed and doesn’t believe the virus is real. Mom got tested at the hospital but lied about testing positive for 3 days to everyone as we continued to interact. Now that cancer patient has a high fever as well. 

My dad has been coughing and went to work for an entire week because he had a negative rapid test. I told him the test has a high false negative rate and that all the ways to get sick in 2019 still exist today and it was stupid to go to work. He didn’t listen despite his work offering anyone who suspects Covid 2 weeks off. He took a second test a few days later as his symptoms got worse and it came up positive. He was lying to me about being vaccinated until today when it became clear I was the only one in the house who wasn’t getting sick. I have sore tonsils and that’s basically my only symptom. I wasn’t able to get a booster yet so it’s good my original vaccines have held up well for 10 months. 

My sister and her boyfriend are asking me (I pursuing a masters in biology but am not a medical doctor) what they should do because they’re sick and confessed they had never been vaccinated. I exploded on them when perhaps I should have been nicer. It just sucks that they all lied to me when Covid could have made me severely sick if I had a breakthrough infection. 

I threw a bitch and made them delay  Christmas (I also put the meat in the freezer without telling them so they couldn’t have Christmas anyway) until they test negative because my uncle works in a nursing home. Now they’re trying to make me look like the bad guy when they’re the ones who should feel bad. I can’t get it through their heads that they all put people’s lives in danger."	1

"So here is my problem with antivaxers. Ok so. Antivaxers get on my nerves for obvious reasons. They have so many wierd reasons as to why they don't vaccinate their kid. So here is my rebuke.

1. Vaccines cause autism (and everything else). Ok so there is like 5% of the community that is not vaccinated. Of course there are more people who are autistic in the vaccinated community BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE VACCINATED PEOPLE. It's a simple law of proportion. Also autism is not a disease. It is genetic. And even so. You'd rather have a dead kid then a autistic kid? That's fucked up. I don't give two flying fucks about what vaccines may or may not cause. They don't cause any of it. Your essential oils and ""detoxification"" won't do shit. Vaccines will defend you against these LETHAL diseases. It's funny how before vaccines were invented there was a huge amount of kids and people who died to these illnesses. Funny how all they had was fresh air sunlight and other ""detoxification"" methods. YOUR OWN FUNDED STUDIES DISPROVED YOUR AUTISM THEORIES! quit your bullshit!

2:Big pharma are giving toxins to our kids. You believe potatoes draw out toxins....if this is your reason slap a cut potato on the needle mark. There instant ""detoxification"" just vaccinate them.

3:My kid is not vaccinated and they are fine. THEY ARE LUCKY! SO FAR! idk how old they are but again would you rather a dead kid? You want to take that risk? If so why have the kid in the first place?

4:vaccine injury:......needles make marks...band aids...make marks....this isn't rocket science this is what some of the vaccine injury posts are and to those who go for the autism and other posts refer to point 1.

5:Evidence. There are so so so so many papers funded by yourselves and the public and the government so LITERALLY ANY GOOD AND SCIENTIFIC PAPER EVER ON THE SUBJECT that proves vaccines are a positive thing. How much properly researched proof is there on antivax? None.

Get your kid vaccinated. Because if you don't....your kid has a higher probability to die die, if they do die.... YOU caused it. YOU killed them. YOU stole their chance at life. YOU murdered their kid. Because THEY don't have that choice. Only YOU can make sure your kid lives. Vaccinate."	1
"Why do Anti-vax people not have prove. The times you here anti-vaxer state, ( I'm not putting this in me, you have no clue what's in it ), but then go on to try to convince others it's all bad with tracking chips and stuff that doesn't help but is slowly killing you.

1st - Papers you online you all to read on how exactly Vaccines work.

2nd - If there putting Tracking Chips it them, why hasn't anyone found one yet.

3rd - How do you argue ( Don't know what's in them ), but then argue its all bad.

I will never get there's people, probably the same people that thinks the US made the Aids in a lab, believing the KGB in their program to spread the lie around 1984-85."	1
"Scared and looking for action steps Hi - 30 y/o M here.

So, I'm a sexually active person who is usually safe in my endeavors (in terms of knowing who I'm sleeping with, using protection when applicable, etc) but was just involved in a really shitty situation where essentially I slept with someone who I knew and trusted, and who SPECIFICALLY told me that they didn't have any STDs or anything for me to worry about..
only to find out after sex that she has HPV.

To be honest, I didn't even know what this was, and am shocked that I was never educated in the past on this infection compared to others. 

To make matters worse, she informed me she has the type that puts her at risk for cervical cancer. And now that I'm realizing there are apparently vaccines for this, I'm now checking my immunization records and it doesn't look like i was ever vaccinated.

She told me she never told me because she honestly believed that it didn't impact men, and she personally didn't consider it an STD. I think there was some lack of education and also immaturity on her part (not to mention she showed a complete lack of faith).

With all this said, I'm now scrambling to educate myself on all this more and what I should potentially be prepared for and do in the immediate. Since this is all very recent (the potential exposure occurred within the last 48 hours), I feel like there's nothing to do right this very moment, since apparently nothing would show up on a test for at least several weeks to as long as several months?

It also seems like testing is either difficult , inconsistent/unreliable, or even partially impossible for males specifically.

As far as symptoms go, it seems like id either (a) not ever have any symptoms, (b) have warts, or (c) have no symptoms until G-d forbid developing a HPV-induced cancer one day.

I'm trying not to panic, especially when people are trying to tell me this mostly impacts women, and because the virus also usually goes away on its own. But the current questions on my mind are:

1) Is it a safe bet that I will contract the virus, or is there a chance that I won't even get it despite exposure?

2) When exactly should I attempt to get tested, and where should I go/what is the best way of going about getting tested if this happened recently and am asymptomatic? I.e when is too early to check, when is reasonable to go? 

3) Assuming I will contract it, and if I already know my partner had a cancer-causing strain, how concerned should I be in terms of its impact to my male anatomy (since I don't have a cervix), and probability of still going away on its own? In other words, do the ""worse"" strains (like what my partner seemingly has) not typically go away on its own (for a male) compared to the lower risk strains? Is it true that all strains can ""typically"" to away naturally within a couple years?

4) I am confused about how to then deal with this while I wait on a reasonable timeframe to test , and pending results. Is this something I should be disclosing to sexual partners? And is it true that even simple acts like kissing could cause a transmission? Should I not even be sharing drinks or food with anyone, inducing friends?

5) Even if I ultimately end up completely asymptomatic in the long run, or testing isn't possible and I simply ""don't know"" if I truly have it - if I knew I had sex with an exposed partner, couldn't I then transmit something to another woman, even if personally dormant within me? Where would the line be drawn of not being overly paranoid (if its truly something that so many people contract) while still being safe and continuing a normal sex life?

6) Is it too late to attempt to get a last minute vaccine? Even forgetting the recent exposure, apparently my age may be too late to typically get it?

7) is it true that there's a separate ""oral"" form of this virus that you could get if having open sores in your mouth? This might be overly paranoid , but I have been having temporary gum bleeding from a possible unrelated infection caused by something that got stuck in my teeth recently. Would this constitute an ""open wound"" , or only if it was a canker sore or something?

8) A little off topic, and not something I'd probably actually do, but from a legal perspective - if someone knowingly had a transmissible infection like this and didn't disclose before another person contracted it, is that something they could be liable for? I'm not sure how stuff like that works, but aside from the moral aspect (which is clearly wrong), I feel like this is fucked up enough of a thing that legal action could theoretically be warranted (but maybe I'm wrong?)

9) Is there anything else I should/can do besides anything I mentioned? Especially anything that might be time sensitive?


The thing that blows my mind with this infection (from what I've researched) is that, on one hand, it's semi-dismissed as something that one need not overly panic about (especially as a male) and that it's almost like a ""'common cold"" of STDs, with the majority of people in a given population contracting a form of it in their lifetime - but on the other hand, when the infection is at its worst (or if people have bad luck), it can cause way worse symptoms than many other STDs that people would typically be more afraid of on a surface level. The fact that this can cause cancer is almost like a form of transmissible cancer, when cancer normally isn't something that is contagious in an of itself. 

I'm sure components of my questions and fears above have been posted in different various in scattered parts of this subreddit, and I apologize if I am redundant in anything. I've been reading through threads nonstop and am looking for help/thoughts with my specific situation and context , especially for immediate next steps. I plan to follow up medically on this, and have already made an initial appointment with a GP, but it's already going to be a several weeks wait and not sure if I should be looking at other avenues also in the meantime (i.e. if GP isn't necessarily the move, if I should see a specialty clinic, urgent care, etc).

Sending thanks and appreciation in advance for any helpful information and guidance, and maybe even some relief of fear"	-1
"Did I get HPV? A post-encounter debrief **OMG! I had sex with a hooker/a massage person/a random app hook-up/someone new and I'm worried I've got HPV.**

Welcome to the post you need to stop you spiralling into exhausting anxiety. Let's start with a key question:

**Are you actually worried about HPV or is this just guilt about whatever it is you feel you shouldn't have done?**  I get it. Sometimes when we act in ways that we know might be unhealthy or irrational, we can start worrying about the consequences. Look, you can't put the toothpaste back in the tube. What's done is done. Give yourself some forgiveness.

Or, if this involves someone else being a dick (coercive, non-consensual, gross), dump and block that motherfucking asshole and move on.

**The truth is that you can get HPV at any time, from anyone. And, you're very likely to get it in your lifetime**. So, worrying about one encounter isn't really a productive use of your time. You should assume that, if you're sexually active, you will have HPV at some point in your life. 80%+ of people do by the age of 45. Lifetime chance once you've had a few partners is close to 100%.

I know it's super unsettling to realise that all sex is kinda risky; TV makes it look like you can make out wordlessly with a stranger, tumble into bed without saying anything, have an unprotected fuck and everyone is fine, all the time. But, you know, real life is different.

We have to balance the risks we take with the benefits. Having a sex life is fun, natural and good (when consensual), and there are few people who are happy being celibate for life (which isn't even a 100% foolproof way to avoid HPV, as even a small % of virgins are found to have genital strains). On the flip side, it is good to consider whether you're mentally tough enough to handle really risky behaviour in future. Some of us aren't psychologically equipped for 3am booty calls with anonymous strangers and that's okay. You need to make peace with that.

Get some mental health support and start with fixing your mind. We on Reddit can't tell you if you have contracted HPV from this one event. **Maybe you did, maybe you didn't**. And ultimately, there's not much you can do about it. So it's time to stop worrying.

**But I have symptoms...**  Maybe after your encounter, you started noticing an itch here, a red patch there. This probably isn't related to HPV; most HPV infections are asymptomatic, so you won't feel or see anything. Where HPV does give rise to symptoms, these usually take a few months or even a few years to appear. The most usual symptom is genital warts, which are small skin growths that usually don't hurt or itch. Some people may get other forms of skin dysplasia like skin patches on the penis or vulva - these are quite rare. Bleeding from the vagina can be a sign of more advanced cervical abnormality, but these usually take a long time to develop. In short, if you're experiencing symptoms and you don't know what they are, you don't need to jump to HPV as an explanation.

Oral symptoms could be their own separate post but don't forget that you can have a cold, flu or Covid - just because you got sick after having sex, doesn't mean it's related to any STD. Oral HPV infections are, again, mostly asymptomatic.

Always see a doctor if you notice something going on with your body, but you also don't need to obsess over the symptoms being caused by HPV, especially if they have arisen within a few days of an encounter you already feel weird about.

**I'm sure I have oral cancer...** Okay, adding this one by request of u/xdphv. Oral cancer from HPV represents about 1% of all oral HPV infections. It usually takes many years to develop. If you have a sore throat, mouth ulcers, or ear pain, they are more likely to be caused by a standard infection like strep, Covid, cold, flu, tonsilitis etc. If these symptoms don't go away, then go to get them checked by a doctor. But, statistically, the chances of you having oral cancer are low, and having oral cancer very quickly after an encounter is extremely unlikely. Remember that Dr Google will always say cancer, but we don't need to make assumptions like this without actual evidence!

Oral HPV testing is not usually done and isn't recommended as cancer prevention by the Oral Cancer Foundation. The best thing to do is see an ENT doctor or your GP if you have symptoms, and go to the dentist annually for an oral checkup.

**But my partner had symptoms/a positive test...** It can be scary to realise that we have 'been exposed' to an infection (although the truth is that happens any time we're in close contact with other humans). With HPV there's really nothing you can do at this point - there's no body wash or mouth wash you can use, and there's no way to remove the infection from your body if you do have it.

HPV infections normally pass in time. Most last from a few months up to a couple of years. Your body's immune system needs time to deal with it. There's not a lot you can do to force this to happen (https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/wlbw5z/i\_have\_hpv\_what\_do\_i\_do\_now/).

**But I saw lumps on their anus/penis/vulva...** There are lots of lumps and bumps that people may have on their genitals that may not be warts. If you have open dialogue with your partner you could gently asked if they have ever had these bumps checked out. 

Even if they haven't, it's not really cause to freak out. As above, there's not much you can do right now. If you have a good relationship with your partner, perhaps you could both visit a doctor together. You may or may not develop warts yourself. 

**But I didn't use a condom...** Using condoms is really important with new partners for lots of reasons. But HPV can spread even when using condoms, so this isn't something you need to obsessively beat yourself up over in this instance.

**Should I get tested?**

It's always good to regularly test for STDs and if you've had a risky encounter it's probably wise, but HPV is a bit of a different case.

People with penises are not commonly tested for any form of HPV in most healthcare systems (see: https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/wej62y/men\_people\_with\_penises\_and\_hpv\_some\_mythbusting/) . People with cervixes may be tested for certain strains of HPV in one location (the cervix) every few years, and you may not be able to get a test out of schedule. Even if you can, there's no point in rushing - HPV is probably not detectable right away so you'd need to wait a few months to be sure. And in some cases it may not even be detectable for years. You should go to your next cervical smear on time and keep an eye on yourself in the meanwhile. If you're very worried you can ask for a smear out of schedule. But bear in mind this won't tell you about an external warts infection.

**So, how do I know if I have HPV?** In most cases, you don't. And that's fine. HPV is not an infection that is tested for like other STDs, because it's so ubiquitous and, in most cases, doesn't have a negative outcome. Most people will just never know if they do or don't have it.

**Should I get vaccinated?** Yes. It's not proven to help a current infection, but it will give you more peace of mind in the future. Gardasil protects you against the 9 most prevalent and riskiest types. If you are a sexually active person it's well worth getting (imo).

**Should I tell future partners I was exposed?** This is a controversial issue but my personal opinion is - no, unless you develop symptoms and get an actual diagnosis. Almost everyone you meet will have a prior HPV infection, and will have been 'exposed' multiple times throughout their lives. Many of them will have an infection right now and won't have any idea.

If it's causing you a lot of stress, on the other hand, you could ask partners if they are vaccinated, at least for a few months, and of course use condoms (which mitigate but don't prevent HPV transmission).

**Am I going to get warts?** Most people don't get warts from HPV. If you do get warts, could be from any partner, not necessarily this encounter. Warts are annoying, but they are mostly benign, and they can be removed. I'm speaking here as someone who had to burn their butthole repeatedly over the course of 2 years...warts suck but if you get them, you will live.

**Am I going to get cancer?** Buddy, we're all going to get some kind of cancer. If you have high risk HPV in your life, yes, there is a small chance you can get a form of cancer from it. But you can also get cancer from lots of other things you do every day. Stop smoking, eat your vegetables, and go to your doctor and dentist checkups as recommended. Otherwise, there isn't very much you can do about it, so just live and enjoy your life.

**Am I going to infect my future spouse?** This is such a tricky one because I know some cultures have a lot of emphasis on purity and strong feelings around sex and marriage. When you are married to someone, you will share EVERYTHING with them. Your gut microbiome, the mites that eat the skin off your face, your poop parasites...and yes, you could potentially give them your strain of HPV if you happened to have an active one at that exact moment (which you might not even have by the time you marry). Which, by the way, they could give to you, too.

If you are really worried, you could ask your spouse to get vaccinated, and encourage them to get their smear tests if they have a cervix. Otherwise, try to relax. Statistically, even if you did pass HPV to them, the chances of a dangerous outcome are low.

**Is my life over?** No. You are now one of the billions of people worldwide who have had, have or will have HPV. Welcome to the human race.

Use this opportunity to learn more about sexual health, consider the kinds of sexual and loving relationships you want in your life, address your mental health, and remember to treat others with kindness and compassion. Get your vaccine, buy some nice condoms, eat a salad and enjoy your life :)"	0
"I got hpv while being a virgin and vaccinated against HPV 16 and 18 I cannot reiterate how much my life sucks, and my health sucks. I got vaccinated 10 years ago when in Mexico first got the vaccine for those two strains.

We both had std tests done prior to sex, we didn’t use condom bc I’m already on birth control for PCOS. Little did I know about HPV and its hundred types of strains that I foolishly caught genital warts…

My partner still hasn’t shown any symptoms because he has a stronger immune system than me. 

If I had only known, I wouldn’t have had sex..
I took care of myself to be with someone that I trusted, and now I secretly resent him still. 

My self esteem is also on the floor after I discovered  my diagnosis this year.
I’m only 21 and I had to go through surgery because a fucking wart grew from the inside of my urethra. 

The recovery time was depressing, the first night I spent it awfully after seeing my urine bag attached. I couldn’t swallow the fact that this was happening to me. 

It isn’t just warts, it’s endless anxiety and worry about if I’m going to then again grow a stupid wart in the wrong place. And let’s not forget the Pap smears

Overall I hate guys and penises 

We girls are always suffering worse than guys

"The vaccine mandate was the last straw. I gave notice to my employer today. To start with, I am fully vaccinated.  I will probably get my third dose in the next few weeks. 

I work in a small conservative rural town providing primary care exclusively to Medicaid patients.  I live in a big city 200 miles away and for the last five years, have commuted to this job to work M-W. The clinic I am at was stood up after the ACA’s Medicaid expansion to give patients a PCP instead of having them rely on frequent visits to the ER. I have loved this job.  I work three days a week.  The pay is great. I get to care for the poor and underserved.  I like to think I have made a pretty big difference in the community.

COVID has come with its stressors.  Being a small conservative community, I have heard every conspiracy theory possible about COVID. Everyday it is me trying to educate and push back against the misinformation.  Everyday is a fight to get people to wear masks (including coworkers). Everyday is a futile attempt to get people to get vaccinated.  I have a panel of a thousand patients and to my continuing horror, I have only been able to talk one patient that was on the fence into getting the vaccine.

I have vials of vaccines in the medication fridge ready to go but nobody to wants them.

Nobody believes COVID is real or a serious issue.  It is all a big “libtard” conspiracy. Yet this county has one of the highest infection rates in the state.

The supervising physician, the medical assistants, and the office manager are all unvaccinated. There is a second PA but they had a bad reaction to the first shot and never went back for the second. I am literally the only person in the organization that is fully vaccinated.  They have refused to get vaccinated and have had no plans to get vaccinated.  In fact, they have dissuaded patients out of getting the vaccine.  I keep working there despite this because I think I am doing good for my patients and the community and feel compelled to “fight the good fight.”

Last week, our governor announced a mandate that all teachers and healthcare workers get vaccinated (barring legitimate medical exemption).  

Today, the office manager told me that they may have to close the clinic down because none of them are willing to get vaccinated. They would rather shut things down and abandon the patients and our service to the community than to “get the jab.”

I gave notice today.  I can’t work there anymore. I am at a point where the pay and perks aren’t enough. I can’t argue about it anymore. There is no educating or persuading.  I just can’t do it.

I have pretty much lost all faith in people.

"I dont know how to take this... Hello everyone,

I am 25f. I got a positive result for HPV aptima, LSIL. I know exactly who gave to me, but that is besides the point. I can't really do much about it in terms on that. 
In terms of this virus, this is something new to me. I am still trying to cope with this. I know that I am new here but tbh, it's been already taking a toll on me. I never thought that I would get this virus. The virus I didn't want, I now have. I feel very depressed with this and I don't what to think about it. I was already not having sex with many people due to my herpes diagnoses. I did however, did not take pre caution.  Well, what do i know? 
I just feel extremely low and I do need some support. I dont know what to think of this. I'm sorry for being too negative. 
I believe all im asking for is for some advice and support."	-1
"Pfizer's Vaccine weakens immune response towards viruses like HPV For anyone who is considering to get vaccinated for covid-19, heads up.

''However, they also showed that the vaccine altered the production of inflammatory cytokines by innate immune cells following stimulation with both specific (SARS-CoV-2) and non-specific (viral, fungal and bacterial) stimuli.

Following vaccination, innate immune cells had a reduced response to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), TLR7 and TLR8 – all ligands that play an important role in the immune response to viral infection.''

"How to keep mental health during HPV infection? * Remember that you are not alone.

> HPV infections are so common that nearly all men and women will get at least one type of HPV at some point in their lives. Most people never know that they have been infected and may give HPV to a sex partner without knowing it. Nearly 80 million Americans are currently infected with some type of HPV. About 14 million people in the United States become newly infected each year. [source](https://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/stdfact-hpv.htm)

* You are not dirty or worse than other people. Other people just don't know bout their active or previous infections.

* Calm down. Don't stress yourself. Be patient.

> ""Women who reported self-destructive coping strategies, like drinking, smoking cigarettes or taking drugs when stressed, were more likely to develop an active HPV infection,"" said principal investigator Anna-Barbara Moscicki, MD, FAAP, chief of the Division of Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine and professor of pediatrics at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Medicine. ""We also found that women who were depressed or perceived themselves to have lots of stress were more likely to have HPV persistence,"" she said, adding that this study is the first to show these connections between stress and HPV persistence. [source](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160430100243.htm)

* See this video about HPV infections: https://youtu.be/KOz-bNhEHhQ

* Stop reading random pages and sources about HPV. There is lots of misinformation and scary stories. 

* Stick to reliable websites, for example: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt05-hpv.html) or [McGill](https://www.mcgill.ca/traphpv/hpvfacts).

* Remember that 64% infections clear within 6 months, 80% within 12 months. 

> When researchers looked at the 10 most prevalent types of HPV, they noted 36% of prevalent infections persisted after six months, 20% persisted to 12 months, 13% persisted to 18 months and 9% persisted to 24 months (95% CI for all). [source](

* Remember that HPV is not for life.

> Most HPV infections in young men and women are transient, lasting no more than one or two years. Usually, the body clears the infection on its own. It is estimated that the infection will persist in only about 1% of women. It is those infections that persist which may lead to cancer. There is some research that suggests that the virus can hide deep in the affected mucosa or skin for several years, below detectable levels. These are called “latent” infections. Having an HPV-positive test followed by an HPV-negative test might mean two different things: that the virus has been completely cleared by the body, or that the level of infection is so small that laboratory tests cannot detect it. Thus, HPV might “reappear” several years after an infection (whether or not it was treated) when the immune system weakens (because of aging, pregnancy, illness, etc.) and then cause lesions. It is unknown what proportion of HPV infections go latent, nor what proportions are truly cleared by the body.

https://mcgill.ca/traphpv/hpvfacts

* If you have CIN then calm down too:

>HPV infection is necessary but not sufficient to develop CIN. More than 90% of infections are spontaneously cleared by the immune system within one year without treatment. Approximately 60% of CIN 1 lesions regress without treatment and less than 1% progress to cancer. However, it is estimated that 5% of CIN 2 and 12% of CIN 3 cases will progress to invasive cancer if untreated. In general, it takes 10 to 20 years for CIN to progress to cancer, allowing a significant time period for detection and treatment. Progression from CIN to cancer requires persistent HPV infection.

> Co-factors associated with persistent HPV infection and progression of disease include smoking, HIV infection, and other types of immunosuppression.

* Start eating healthy food.  

>  Previous studies have reported that women with lower intakes of vegetables and fruits as well as vitamins A, C, and E have a higher risk of high grade CIN and CC [9,12]. Accordingly, our study highlighted the protective role of the prudent dietary pattern, a Mediterranean-like diet pattern, which was negatively associated with the risk of CIN2+. Particularly, CIN2+ risk was lower among women with medium–high adherence, compared to those with low adherence to the prudent pattern. [source](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/4/469/htm)

> People who eat fruits and vegetables, which happen to be good sources of antioxidants and other phytochemicals, have a lower risk of heart disease and some neurological diseases, and there is evidence that some types of vegetables and fruits in general, protect against a number of cancers as epidemiological studies revealed, without providing the answer whether any specific bioactive molecules within fruit and vegetable have a special contribution on lower incidence. However, 80% of American children and adolescents and 68% of adults do not eat five portions a day. Inadequate dietary intakes of vitamins and minerals are widespread, most likely due to excessive consumption of energy-rich, micronutrient-poor, and refined food.

* You don't need to take any supplements to clear infection, however many people like to 
""do something"", just to feel better. If you have low risk HPV infection you can think about i.e. combined therapy with Inosine Pranobex or oral Zinc. If you have high risk HPV infection you can think about i.e. Inosine Pranobex or medicinal mushrooms. https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/d6qkh6/medicinal_mushrooms_immunostimulants_dietary/

* but remember: healthy lifestyle is enough to clear HPV infection.

* Daily exercise is a good idea. Check Team Body Project channel on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFjc9H89-RpWuIStDqhO7AQ). Personally I don't like exercises, but I started 2 months ago with this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC_L9qAHVJ8

* If you think too much about HPV then focus on something else, do something. Read books? Travel? Watch Netflix? HBO? Cook? Exercise? Play on PlayStation 4? Xbox One? 

* Read what different doctors say about HPV infections: 

> “HPV is extraordinarily common and is the most common sexually transmitted disease. Almost every sexually active person gets exposed to at least one, if not several, of the 15 carcinogenic viruses,” said Mark Schiffman, MD, head of the HPV unit at the Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics at the National Cancer Institute (NCI).

> “If you’ve got HIV, you’ve got HIV, but if you’ve got HPV, you’re about to not have HPV,” Schiffman said. “Nine out of 10 times you don’t have it in two years. Maybe your body suppresses it like chickenpox, maybe it is completely gone, but the result is that you are OK.”

> “If you look at the curve, what it shows is that if you wait six months, you’ve gotten rid of half your worry,” Schiffman said.

* After HPV clearance it's possible to get reinfected with the same strain so if you can then get the vaccine (Gardasil or Gardasil 9)

"A personal experience about STD and HIV fear/paranoia **Disclaimer: I AM NOT A DOCTOR. I AM JUST A PERSON WITH POSSIBLE OCD AND SOME EXPERINCE WITH HIV/STD FEAR. THIS TEXT AIMS PEOPLE WHO USED PROTECTION BUT STILL CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBLITY OF INFECTION.**

Hey guys,

I know there will be some people on internet who are looking for answers regarding a possible infection. What I'm going to write is only about the unnecessary fear that you might have, which I can try to help with my personal experiences. 

Even though, I've never been to psychiatrist, I can say that it's possible I have OCD. If you're really struggling with STD or HIV fear, I'd suggest you to search about the term OCD. 

First I want to start with HIV,

You can find the transmission rates on the internet, and you will see that it's pretty hard to get but knowing that many people still get it, will increase your level of stress and anxiety. 

I had my first HIV paranoia nearly 6 months ago. The only reason it started, I gave oral to a girl and after I had sex with her, I found out that oral sex can transmit HIV. But when I say, it can, it's really close to zero risk and of course it's not zero.  Probably I read every comment and post on the internet, and talked to many real doctors. One thing that rise the risk of transmission is if you have bleeding gums in your mouth. In that time, I had that problem. And for 3 weeks, I lived in complete fear. The only thing that killed my fear was a negative PCR test result. HIV PCR tests can detect as earl as 9 to 11 days, unlike the other test. But either you need to pay 10 times more for the test, or doctor needs to believe you had a high exposure event. In my case, I went to a private clinic and I had to pay a lot. Even though I used protection, it was one night stand and I gave oral sex to a girl while I had bleeding gums that bleeds sometimes tbh. 

What I want to share with you is the stress induced fake symptoms I had. You might think that for some reason you infected with HIV. And you're probably reading about the symptoms. As the virus of HIV is attacking your immune system, you get similar symptoms when you have a weakened immune system. If you're obsessed with the possibility of infection with HIV, your anxiety and stress level cause physical symptoms. You can read that everything can caused by stress, but in reality it's hard to believe that. But let me tell you my symptoms that were due to stress;

* **Diarrhea**
* **Low fever**
* **Herpes or a sore on lips (oral herpes are pretty common, I don't mean hsv 2)**
* **Bleeding gums**
* **Dry mouth or lips**
* **Sore throat** 
* **Feeling of having something stuck in your throat** 
* **Pain, tingling and soreness around genitals (I will explain this later)** 
* **Back pain**

The problem is when you have one of these symptoms it makes you more stressful and eventually you're messing up your immune system. And a weakened immune system results in fake HIV symptoms.  

After my exposure, or a possible exposure, another fear I had was getting infected with genital herpes. As I accidentally exposed my scrotum to hot water (for a stupid reason), I had some redness in that area and it made me think about genital herpes. But what kept me with the obsessed with the fear of getting genital herpes was having tingling, pain and soreness around my genitals. The rash I had was not for genital herpes, yet I always felt like I had an incoming outbreak. When I was searching about stress, I read about Pelvic Floor Dysfunction which can emerge due to stress. In general it's not for common to have this problem for men, yet after I completely relaxed, I did not have any problem in my genitals. So, even if you're men, if you have pain in your genitals, when you're not urinating, and if you are under stress, that could be the reason. 

4 weeks ago I had my second HIV paranoia and I decided to remove one nights stands from my life completely. Right now, I know I'm HIV negative but I'm stil afraid of HPV and herpes. I just wanted to write this text in order to tell  that if you're protected during sex but still having symptoms for STD's or HIV, it's more likely it's because of your anxiety or stress level. It took me 3 weeks to understand that, you maybe you can feel better, eat and even sleep properly. **Lastly, I want to say that, the only way to know if you are STD free or not, is getting tested.**"	0

My Dr. Has already informed me that I will need a hysterectomy. I'm very nervous. I'm afraid the ct scan will show that it has spread and there is no hope left. Anyone else in this situation and can tell me what the chances are that my cancer is bad? I have the following systems: lower abdomen pain, lower back pain, lower right side pain where appendix is, itchy private parts, very light bleeding inbweteen periods, painful periods. I don't have pain during sex. I have been having more frequent bowl movemts, not dieahrea, just very small amounts through out the day. No blood in stool or urine. 	0
"If there's evidence the vaccine or vaccines in general increase ones chance of surviving and avoiding illness, STATE the bloody value, give us some numbers.. Like what is it 1.25X more likely to die unvaccinated aged 20-30? 1.5X more likely to die unvaccinated age 60-70? What is it? Give the number! Even better would be age 20-25 and 25-30 and so on..

"When I saw an obese guy shouting abuse at an anti vaxxer, I actually understood him, I understood that he has a reason to be angry at protesting anti vaxxers, and here's why; So this guy is like 53, and at risk of COVID, more than most.

Being anti vaccine is like saying to this guy, ""That cure you desperately need to survive COVID, it might not be so good you know! It might not work so well or be so safe!""

It's like you're telling the guy that his escape from the threat of covid19 might not be such an escape as he thinks. 

So it's not bloody wonder he's angry. He's being told inadvertently that he's in danger of disease and death.

"Urgent 3 day referral Hi guys!

Be patient with me as my grammar and punctuation has never been the best.

I had a smear test last year that came back with CIN 1 low grade dyskaryosis and positive for a rare HPV strain that can cause cervical cancer. They did a colposcopy didn’t take any samples and were happy for me to return this year for another smear with two different types of swabs this year.

 I get really bad pain in my pelvis after sex and in general with discharge every day. I went for this years smear two weeks ago and received a phone call yesterday with an urgent referral that I need to be seen Friday for a colposcopy non negotiable. I am now obviously completely freaking out as after calling around several places (I’m uk based) they won’t give up my results so that I can be prepared for the appointment knowing what I’m going into. I just want to know if anyone’s been in the same boat and am I right to be as worried as I am? 

I’m so frightened that it was worse than they thought as they did not take a biopsy last year and it’s now suspected early on cancer where I’m so sore all of the time. I can’t relax as I’m going nuts worrying even though I’ll find out my fate in two days. I am only 26 by the way!

I personally think what the government is talking about is good. I think its good that they want to control all of our personal lives.. because we obviosuly cant do it ourselves, So it's obviously better to have experts telling us how to live it. Police to enforce the curfew with strict order, even violence if need be.

Me personally, I think a tracking device in form of a wristband is a good idea. Maybe as Bill gates talks about, a digital tatoo or RFID chip under the skin? top notch survilliance of all puplic places to find those who have not gotten their vaccine or citizens who may appear sick. Its important we send out a message, ALL NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE for everybody, especially the weak. Its our duty! Other things I could see would be a good idea is, like WHO said, getting acces to our homes to find the people who are sick and spreading the highly infectious disease to their sposes, kids or other family. We cant have that risky amount of personal freedom anymore, if not ever again, it's to much of a risk if another virus starts spreading.

I hope this sub won't delete the post as well, because I'm genuinely curious about the topic of vaccine shedding.

So yeah, here it is. I'm looking forward to you guys' opinions.

- - -

I'm a pro-vaxxer and biology student (3rd semester).

I have no doubts about the effectiveness of covid vaccines, although I have to admit that the way politicians handled the topic during the pandemic was problematic to say the least. Absolute claims like ""If you don't get vaxxed, you'll definitely get covid"" and vice versa, are unscientific and harmful to society.

After we got that out of the way, here is what I want to know from antivaxxers/vaccine-sceptics:

We all know the term ""vaccine shedding"". People who use it, imply, that it is somehow possible to ""shed"" the spike protein after its synthesis got initiated by the RNA blueprint in covid vaccines. In other words: Vaccinated people can somehow shed the spike-protein to other people.

Now, here's my problem: How is this supposed to work?

I think we can all agree on how the mechanism of mRNA vaccines works:

The vaccine contains a RNA blueprint encapsulated in nanolipids. After vaccination, the RNA enters your cell's cytosol, where it then connects to a ribosome. This ribosome then reads the genetic information from the RNA strain and initiates the proteinbiosynthesis of the isolated spike-protein, which is normally found on the surface of SC2s viral body. SC2 uses those proteins to hijack host cells with ACE2 surface receptors.

Now, because the spike-protein has no relevant functionality without the rest of the viral structure and because it's already located inside of the cell after being synthesized, there is no reason to assume any relevant complications may arise after vaccination.

There is also no reason to assume that it's somehow possible for the spike-protein to infect other people. This would require the protein to somehow leave your cells and get transmitted to another person.

And even if that would happen: What damage could the spike-protein cause without the rest of the viral structure? It would enter your cells by hijacking the ACE2 surface receptors - fine. And then? It would immeadiatly get recognized and neutralized by your immune system, just like after vaccination.

So yeah, I would appreciate some scientific input regarding this topic. I'm not making this post in bad faith. It's always possible to miss new scientific data."	0
"Clearing HPV - My Journey Hey Everyone,

This is my first Reddit post and I debated for quite a while before making it. I have never spoken to anyone about my HPV journey - but I know how terrifying this experience can be (especially when there is such a stigma around STDs). And so for anyone who is going through this now, please know that it does get better. And while I’m not a licensed medical professional, I am always happy to share things that I did that worked for me. But before we get into any of that… I guess I should start at the beginning….

I’ve only ever been with one person in my life. I got into my first (and only) relationship in October, 2022. Well. Maybe “relationship” is a bit of a stetch - “situationship” might be better suited. My family is a bit on the conservative side as well, so it wasn’t something that my family knew about (or would approve of if they knew). 

March 2023 was when I realized something was wrong. I was essentially spotting intermittently for an entire month with no period. Spotting isn’t normal for me - especially over the course of an entire month. That’s what led to my very first gynecologist appointment. Since I’d never had a pap smear before, the doctor did one as part of the routine check up. It turned out that the spotting was in fact, most likely the side effect of a bad flu that I’d had the previous month. 

I didn’t think much of it at the time since I wasn’t expecting anything terrible to come of the pap. I was wrong. Two weeks later, I got a phone call from my doctor. The phone call probably lasted all of three minutes and I was informed that I had high risk HPV. My mind was, quite honestly, numb, hearing those three horrible letters. My words came across jumbled and confused, and the only thing that came to mind was “how can I have HPV when I’ve only been with one person in my life?” It turned out that I had voiced my thoughts out loud because the next thing I heard was the doctor’s response. Something along the lines of “well, do you know how many people he has been with?”

And of course, I had nothing to say to that. I didn’t think it was common practice for someone to quiz their situationship about how many past relationships they’ve had. Even if I had, and I’d gotten a number, it wouldn’t have been of any use because men are carriers of HPV and men have no test for HPV. I have never felt as ashamed, terrified, dirty or alone as I did in that moment, on the call with my doctor. I definitely spent more than a few days depressed in bed, unable to stop catastrophizing. It was when I started getting my head back in the game that I made a plan for myself. 

First things first - for anyone going through this now, know the facts: 
- more than 80% of people have or will have HPV at some point in their lives and 90% of cases clear on their own. You are not the exception.
- HPV is a viral infection. That’s all. Having it doesn’t make you unclean in any way
- HPV does not imply that you’re promiscuous. Case-in-point, I have only been with one person.
- The human body is extremely resilient and is strong enough to heal itself if you give it the right support.

I had to save these points under the notes section of my phone so i could read it when I felt anxious.

Second, I knew I needed to strengthen my immune system as much as possible so I made some huge diet and lifestyle changes:
- I slept earlier and slept MORE. Sleep works wonders for your immune system
- I significantly increased my intake of fruits. I ONLY ate fruits for breakfast (sometimes in smoothie form). Staple fruits that I incorporated everyday were blueberries, blackberries, raspberries and oranges. 
- I significantly increased my intake of salads and cruciferous veggies (I was eating cauliflower for lunch twice a week and as much salad as possible)
- No drinking or smoking
- I did not stop having sex, but instead practiced safe sex.

Third, I took a few supplements to help boost my immunity. Most regularly, I took beta glucan and AHCC. I also took vitamin C pills off and on. 

My recent pap/HPV test has now come back negative for all high risk HPV types! I hope my experience with clearing HPV is able to help others as well. You are not alone and you can do it!!!"	0

"How do I tell the guy I have been sleeping with that I tested HPV-16 positive (he probably gave it to me) Hello everyone! I’m looking for advice or similar experiences. I have been seeing this guy once or max twice a week since two months. At some point we started doing it without protection (so stupid I know). He went now on holidays for 20 days and I took the time to do general STD tests. It turns out I’m HPV-16 positive. I had not tested for long time but before this guy I had a two year boyfriend and thus was not sleeping with other people. Me and the guy in question have never spoken about being serious or anything but I really like him and I don’t want to stop seeing him, even though I suspect it was him who probably gave it to me because after a few times of sleeping with him I got a wart (gynecologist took it away by now). I know I now have to tell him I have HPV but I’m so scared and embarrassed… I don’t want him to think I gave it to him but I also don’t want to blame him. I’m scared also that he doesn’t want to see me anymore because of this? Any tips on how I should approach the conversation? And experiences on how non-boyfriends have reacted to this conversations?

Thank you so much "	0
"HPV+ SCC Treatment Info 5 weeks post treatment and wanted to share my experience and some suggestions that seemed to be very helpful. This group has been wonderful for me and I’d just like to give back what I can. I have a lot of support around me, I live in a city with two great cancer treatment centers, my wife is a doctor, etc., so might have some info that others do not. Lots of this info I got from your posts.

I am a 55 yo male, 6-1 195 when I was diagnosed with HPV+ squamous cell carcinoma on my left tonsil that had metastasized to a lymph node. When the lymph node swelled up and didn’t resolve like a normal cold, I saw a doc and got it biopsied. Radical tonsillectomy and 7 weeks of radiation (35 treatments) along with 7 doses of Chemo (cisplatin) was the toughest thing I have ever had to deal with. At 6 weeks post treatment I am eating some solids and actually went out with friends for NYE! I lost 15 lbs but overall came through it pretty well apparently. Still struggling with dry mouth and taste like everyone and still drinking protein shakes to keep weight where it is. I was told 3000 calories per day to keep weight on through treatment and I am shocked how accurate that was. That may have been the biggest challenge of all. Here are some things I think had the most effect:

Water – 80 oz per day. This seems crazy I know but its what every medical person told me. We bought a graduated pitcher, and every morning filled it up so that it tracked my intake and motivated me to keep drinking. The days I didn’t, I could tell the difference in mucous and throat dryness for sure.

Protein Shakes – Kate Farms base, protein powder, yogurt, 750 calories ea. Use vegan protein powder which you get through medical outfits like Thorne brand. The store bought powders have diary and whey proteins which produce mucous. Ensure and other mainstream protein drinks also have bad ingredients like corn sugar, etc. Olive oil and non dairy (again for mucous) ice cream to get calories up. My wife would make these shakes 4 times a day (750 cal ea) and it was all I could do to get them down every day, but I wanted to avoid the feeding tube at all costs! We got these huge straws that helped a lot to hold my breath and power them down.

Humidifiers – One where you hang out all day, one next to your bed. I could tell when I didn’t sleep with it on that, like the water, my throat would be more dry and the mucous would be worse.

Skin – StrataXRT gel, ask your doctor. It’s a prescription I heard about here on Reddit. You apply it twice a day and I never had any open sores or issues with my skin. It costs about $80/tube and I got 3 weeks per tube so went through 3 tubes but might figure to get 4 for the weeks after treatment. My doctors had heard of it but were very interested to see how it did and please with the results.

Aupuncture – I was told this could possibly help reduce the dry mouth so went twice a week starting in week 2. I am not a fan, don’t like getting stuck, but would do anything if it will help! My practitioner did electro stimulation also and I really do think it helped. It seemed to stop the progression of the dry mouth during treatment. A couple of weeks after treatment I didn’t think I was getting much from it so stopped. One of the doctors at the hospital told me of a study that showed acupuncture during treatment showed a 50% better result than no acupuncture during treatment but not much help afterward, which seems to align with my experience. 

Anyway, I hope some of this helps those that are going through this horrible experience. Keep positive though, it is tough but you’ll be through it before you know it!"	0
"Horrible periods and now HPV+ CIN 2/3 I have multiple issues happening with my reproductive bits all at once. Starting with an ovarian cyst that’s become more painful over the years (10+ yrs). Then my periods became more and more symptomatic and painful in November 2023. I already have an IUD to control the bleeding that was super successful for the last 15+ years (yes I replaced them). But now, sex is painful, cramps just about 2 weeks or more each month. I’m living under a heating pad and gain almost 10lbs during my cycle each month. I found out about a month ago that I have HPV and CIN 2/3.

Due to the above my Dr has referred me to surgical OB/GYN to discuss a hysterectomy among other procedures. I have a consult with her June 4th. I’m 43, mother to one awesome son.

Anyone take a similar path and have experience, strength or hope to share? "	0
"The Trump Presidency was the greatest thing to ever happen to America. Love him, or hate him, President Trump was able to expose the media as the frauds they are. No matter what position Trump took on a issue the media took the opposite. 

The biggest example of this is the VACCINE. Trump got the Vaccine out in record time. But what was the medias position of the Vaccine when Trump was in charge? Well they gave a History lesson on why rushed Vaccines are BAD. 

https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/01/health/eua-coronavirus-vaccine-history/index.html

One of my favorite articles highlighting the pure hypocrisy because it was funded by Trump ^. But hey I’m the Conspiracy Theorist lmao ??. 

And another example War. Remember when the Media was accusing Trump of starting a War with Iran after Iran shot down there own plane? I do. 

Any War started by Trump and the media was going insane. Any War Trump tried to leave and the media went insane. But now the media totally supports World War 3 with Russia. Why? Because it’s Biden and not Trump. It’s (D)ifferent. In the last week I’ve heard more talk of Nuclear War then in the last 30 years. As if it’s totally normal. 

Yet here we are. 1+ year later with Biden and the media has done a 360 flip. The media actually did there job when Trump was in charge. They QUESTIONED what the government was doing. But with Biden they don’t question the governments actions like they did with Trump. The media repeats the government’s talking points. And if you don’t repeat our talking points it’s “Misinformation” or your a agent of PUTIN! Claim Fact Checkers. 

Trump: Build A Wall. !

The Media: That’s Racist! 

Washington: Jan 6th was a Insurrection! Were going to build a Wall around buildings the Public owns twice. 

The Media: Okay. We fine with that. Totally normal and not at all a indicator of a Dictatorship or anything. 

I could go on and on. The Trump Presidency exposed the Hypocrisy of the media. Rushed Vaccines are bad under Trump. But under Biden you better take this rushed Vaccine or you no longer have a job. Trump is old. But unlike many of the old Politicians Trump stopped being one after his 1st Political job. He holds no office. Funny how when a complete outsider takes power the Deep State goes absolutely insane. President Bush committed real war crimes. Democrats threaten to impeach Bush many times. But they didn’t. Bush is a elite insiders. Trump is a outsider. That’s why Trump went down as the only President to be impeached twice. Once over Ukraine. And again over fake insurrection that never happened. 

Hunter Biden Laptop is Russian Misinformation! Yet 1 year later the Hunter Biden Laptop is real. Why isn’t the media calling for the impeachment of Joe Biden? Hunter Biden has a ton of Child Porn on his Laptop. Yet after being confirmed to be the real the media still ignores the CP. The media searched high and low for the Golden Shower Tape and it turns it to be fake. Yet the CP on Hunter Biden? Silence. 

The game is rigged. The outsider beat the insider. Hillary was chosen to be President. Trump’s election was the only real election win in a long time."	-1
"After 10 years of struggle, I am finally HPV FREE! I won’t make this a really long message, but I have to share my story and tell you what I did to finally receive a “not detected” HPV test.

10 years ago I had my first PAP smear and it came back positive for High Risk HPV. I thought it would clear in 2-3 years. Nope it didn’t, because I did 2 more HPV tests, the last one being 2 years ago, and it still came back positive for high risk. 

3 years ago I contracted GW. Luckily I only had them removed once with a laser, and the second time 1 small one appeared and I used Aldara cream and it vanished in 3 days. (I don’t have any HPV strains that are related to GW, and I always found that weird).

Anyways, last summer when I was applying the Aldara cream, I was miserable. I couldn’t believe that it came back after 3 years of not having it. So I decided to really do research, and when I say research, as in dive deep into articles, YouTube videos and blogs. I came across different supplements. For each I did research. 

Four days ago I did my annual Pap smear. It came back “normal”. And I’ve never had a normal Pap smear. It was always CIN2. But this time it came back normal and it took me by surprise!! My Gyno told me that I should be happy and that I don’t need to do a HPV genotype test. I didn’t listen to her, and I paid for the test anyways, because I just knew that it would come back positive. It has been for the past 10 years, so why would it come back negative all of a sudden? Well, when it did come back “non detective” I could not believe my eyes. I’m still in shock and in disbelief. Happy would be an understatement!

Below listed are all the supplements I have been taking for the past 8 months that I 100% believe cured my HPV. 
1) Trametes versicolor - Turkey Tail 1g
2) Ganoderma Lucidum- Reishi 1g
3) Folic Acid - 800mcg
4) Vitamic C - 1g
5) Vitamin B12 - 1000mcg
6) Vitamin D-3 - 5000 IU
7) Zinc Sulfate- 50mg

I take them every day, once a day after a meal. 

I’m sharing this with you, because I know there’s someone out there who has given up hope and is miserable. Don’t give up. Please invest in mushroom supplements. It changed my life, and I hope yours will too!

"CIN 1 HR HPV Late August of 2023, I went to my family doctor as I was having odd symptoms for quite some time. During intercourse, I was bleeding A LOT. I was losing weight unexplainably (at the time I was body building, should have been maintaining and/or gaining). I had a Pap smear and HPV test ran, and it came back ASCUS and HR HPV for 12 different strains, but NO 16 or 18. Upon being referred to a gynecologist, I also had a cervical ultrasound which came back clear. I then had a colposcopy, which came back CIN-1 LSIL in two different spots on my cervix. I was then told to wait 6 months until a follow up was needed. 

In the mean time, I have had continued symptoms. Still bleeding during intercourse. My appointment for my Pap smear is in a month and I have had constant anxiety about all of this. Ultimately, just curious about anyone else and their experience and if you have had anything similar to my story, and what those results were. 

I’m 26, I have a 3 year old, and plan to have more children. I know this cancer is not genetic, but both my mother and grandmother have had cervical cancer and have since had hysterectomies as a result. Sincerely seeking some peace of mind or advice ??"	0
Im having trouble finding evidence, could anyone help me? I am looking for articles, blog posts, academic journals, etc. AGAINST vaccines.

Please send any you may know of. Thank you!	0

"Why can't people just accept it's a bad vaccine? Why go on to say it's not a vaccine at all? It makes us look stupid because even people like Bret Weinstein and Dr Malone are calling it not a vaccine but they never give an argument for why it isn't, they don't use defintions or origins of the word vaccine, they just assert it isn't a vaccine.

I've yet to hear a good argument for why it isn't a vaccine. 

Where in the definition of a vaccine does it say you need to directly introduce a piece of the virus into the body? Where does it exclude putting genetic code to produce parts of the virus into the body?

The vaccine sucks, There's no doubt .. but it is a vaccine as far as I can tell. 

(There's no need to get heated, I'm just a bit concerned that this ""not a vaccine"" cul-de-sac isn't worth going down)"	0
"My warts evolved. Planter warts on my feet from 20 years ago, turned into little red hives, now they are turning into tiny blisters and spreading rapidly all over my foot. I had this happen before on my hand getting completely covered and eaten by warts and when it was over my hand looked like swiss cheese with dead skin everywhere. If that happens again, I'll definitely post pictures, for now it's mostly uninteresting. 

Did you know HPV/Warts cause cancer and never truly die or leave your body? They stay there, biding there time, looking for a new evolutionary path to escape the immune system. It's like having a baby version of aids."	0
"I cleared persistent, high-risk HPV I had persistent HPV-16 for a minimum of 5 years (as my current partner and I have been together for 5 years and I couldh've contracted it before). I was another positive test away from a colposcopy and I told the gynae to give me 6 more months to try and clear it, before doing the colp here's what I did:

(Please bare in mind there's no way of knowing what cleared the virus, but if you want to toss the net wide like I did, here's the info) 

1) I took AHCC for the first two months.  It's quite expensive and doesnt have many clinical trials but I gave it a shot and invested in it. After 2 months I stopped taking it. 
2) I took vitamin B complex every day (studies have been linked between vit B and clearing HPV). I did this for 6 months. 
3) my gynae suggested the guardasil 9 vaccine to try and 'kick start' my immune system to clear the existing virus. I had my first dose, was supposed to do two more but just stuck to one for some reason. 
4) I increased my water intake to 2 liters at least a day (not a big water drinker as it is)
5) barely drunk alcohol (once a month I would say). I also don't smoke/vape as it is 
6) healthier diet, managed stress, truly and emphatically put my body's needs first. 
7) used condoms with my partner (no idea if you can pass it back or not, I don't think the medical comm is even clear on this but I pulled out the stops)
8) every morning I would do a womb healing meditation/ I would
Put music on and visualize by body producing the perfect, glowing antibody. Attaching to the virus and rendering it in effective. 

A mix of things: mindfulness, evidence based, intuitive based AND TESTED NEGATIVE FOR HPV A FEE DAYS AGO. 

I know it can lie dormant so I will keep up what I have done and retest in 6 more months. I hope this helps someone out there.

"Young tennis player gets blood clot in her arm. Anti-vaxxers blame the vaccine, though fail to recognize something called Paget-Schroetter syndrome. Nelly Korda is a young golf player who recently suffered a subclavian vein thrombosis in her arm. 

Had to be the vaccine. No other possibility, right? 

Could it be birth control pills? Factor V mutations? An innate or externally precipitated hormonal imbalance? Any other number of conditions that have caused clots for decades, if not centuries? 

Or could it, given the context of her life, be something called ‘effort vein thrombosis’, which was *first described in the 1960s*, far long before mRNA vaccines? 

What is ‘effort vein thrombosis’, you ask?

> [Subclavian thrombosis caused by “**Repetitive movement of the arm and shoulder with over the head extension**”](https://uvahealth.com/services/vascular-disease-care/effort-subclavian-vein-thrombosis)

Given the fact that Nelly required surgical intervention rather than simple thrombolytics (or blood thinners), it’s likely that she also had an anatomic anomaly that is often implicated in this condition (see above link) — which likely prompted removal of a segment of her rib or ligament, which can compress subclavian veins and promote thrombosis. 

Weird, right? It’s almost like the body is strange and complex in its own right, and sometimes bad things happen unexpectedly, without conspiracy. 

But anyway! My burgeoning degree of paranoid schizophrenia still points me to the vaccine as the definite and only cause."	-1
Change of Viewpoint Hopefully this is the right sub for this, but I feel like my mind has changed regarding vaccines. I’ve received vaccines throughout my life, but as an adult, became more hesitant about vaccines, and honestly, I was anti-vaccine. I’m 39 weeks pregnant and my viewpoint of vaccines have really shifted. A couple months ago I was in the “no vaccines after birth” crowd and now I intend to vaccinate my child after birth and I’m glad I have the resources and availability to do so. I’ve always been a researcher and heavily believe in informed consent and weighing the risks of everything. I’m not sure what exactly sparked the change in mindset, other than education and risk-analysis, but I was wondering if this is normal and if anyone else went from anti-vaccine to pro-vaccine?	1

"Typical day in the COVID unit A lot of people have been asking me what it's like being on the COVID wards in the hospital, so I figured I'd share what a typical day looks like for me:

6am - Wake up. Roll off of my pile of money that Big Pharma gave me. Softly weep as it doesn’t put a dent in my medical school loans

6:30am - Make breakfast, using only foods from the diet that gives me everlasting life by avoiding all fats, sugars, carbs, and proteins. For details buy my book and check out my shop.

7am - Get to work, load up my syringes with coronavirus before rounds.

8am - See my patients for the day. Administer the medications that the government tells me to. Covertly rub essential oils on the ones I want to get better.

9:30am - Call Bill Gates to check how 5G tower construction is going, hoping for more coronavirus soon. He tells me they’re delayed due to repairs on the towers used to spread the Black Plague. Curse the fact that this is the most efficient way to spread infectious diseases.

10am - One patient tells me he knows “the truth” about coronavirus. I give him a Tdap booster. He becomes autistic in front of my eyes. He’ll never conspire against me again.

11am - Tend to the secret hospital garden of St. John’s wort and ginkgo leaves that we save for rich patients and donors. 

12:30pm - Pick up my briefcase of money from payroll, my gift from Pfizer for the incomprehensible profits we make off of the free influenza vaccine given every year. 

1pm - Conference call with Dr. Fauci and the lab in Wuhan responsible for manufacturing viruses. Tell them my idea about how an apocalypse-style zombie virus would be a cool one to try for the next batch.

2pm - A patient starts asking me about getting rid of toxins. I ask her if she has a liver and kidneys. She tells me she knows “the truth” about Big Anatomy and that the only way to detoxify herself is to eat nothing but lemon wedges and mayonnaise for weeks. I give her a Tdap booster.

2:45pm - Help the FBI, CIA, and CDC silence the masses. Lament the fact that I can only infringe on one or two of their rights. Oh well, there’s always tomorrow.

4pm - One of my rich patients begins to crash. Laugh as I realize I’ve mismatched her spirit animal and zodiac moon sign. I switch out the Purple Amethyst above her bed for a Tiger’s Eye geode. She stabilizes. I throw some ginkgo leaves on her for good measure

6pm - Go onto YouTube and see coronavirus conspiracy videos everywhere. Curse my all powerful government for how inept they are at keeping people from spreading “the truth”

6:10pm - Go onto Amazon and see that a book about “the truth” is the #1 seller this week. Question the power of my all powerful government. Make a reminder to myself to get more Tdap boosters from the Surgeon General next time we talk. 

7pm - Time to go home. Before I leave, sacrifice a goat to Dr. Fauci and say three Hippocratic Oaths.

9pm - Take a contented sigh as I snuggle under the covers made of the tinfoil hats of my enemies, realizing that my 4 years of medical school and 3 years of residency training have been put to good use today.

"AI"" Suggested I Slow My Roll When It Comes To Getting 5 Vaccines This Fall? I wrote ""I plan on getting 5 vaccines this Fall one week after the other. RSV, pneumococcal, Tdap vaccine, FLU and COVID. I am a 74 year old male in relatively good health. Is this a viable plan?""

AI: It's great that you're staying proactive about your health! However, getting five vaccines in such a short span of time might not be the best approach. The immune system can become overwhelmed, and it's generally recommended to space out vaccines to ensure each one is effective and to monitor for any potential side effects.

Do you all agree? It's possible AI missed that I was thinking of getting them a week apart."	0
"I just reported my former best friend to the FBI I feel awful, but it needed to be done.

I grew up with her. We did everything together. She was such a beautiful, kind-hearted free spirit. Then she got married to a conservative guy, and they moved to the bible belt. She became an evangelical Christian, and we drifted apart because we became too different. I still have her on my Facebook friends list, and it hurt to see her turn into an anti-vaxxer, anti-masker, and hardcore Trump supporter. She constantly spews hate on Facebook. She's a homophobic person who, like many evangelical Christians, also looks down on working women ""because women belong in the kitchen"". I don't know who she is anymore.

The other day, she posted a cruel diatribe against President Biden because he mandated vaccines for the military and companies with 100+ employees. In the comments section, she, her husband, and their Trumper friends said things like, ""If Biden keeps this up, we'll have another January 6th event. And it'll be real this time. We're ready.""

I took that as a threat against the President, the Congress and other government officials. ""This time it'll be real"" is pretty telling. They're implying that more people -- important people -- will get hurt this time. So I reported them to the FBI.

I feel bad for doing that. I miss my friend, but she's not that person anymore.
